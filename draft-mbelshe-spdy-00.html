Abstract

   This document describes SPDY, a protocol designed for low-latency
   transport of content over the World Wide Web. SPDY introduces two
   layers of protocol.  The lower layer is a general purpose framing
   layer which can be used atop a reliable transport (likely TCP) for
   multiplexed, prioritized, and compressed data communication of many
   concurrent streams.  The upper layer of the protocol provides HTTP-
   like semantics for compatibility with existing HTTP application
   servers.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                         June 2013</span>


<span class="h2"><a name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   One of the bottlenecks of HTTP implementations is that HTTP relies on
   multiple connections for concurrency.  This causes several problems,
   including additional round trips for connection setup, slow-start
   delays, and connection rationing by the client, where it tries to
   avoid opening too many connections to any single server.  HTTP
   pipelining helps some, but only achieves partial multiplexing.  In
   addition, pipelining has proven non-deployable in existing browsers
   due to intermediary interference.

   SPDY adds a framing layer for multiplexing multiple, concurrent
   streams across a single TCP connection (or any reliable transport
   stream).  The framing layer is optimized for HTTP-like request-
   response streams, such that applications which run over HTTP today
   can work over SPDY with little or no change on behalf of the web
   application writer.

   The SPDY connection offers four improvements over HTTP:

      Multiplexed requests: There is no limit to the number of requests
      that can be issued concurrently over a single SPDY connection.

      Prioritized requests: Clients can request certain resources to be
      delivered first.  This avoids the problem of congesting the
      network channel with non-critical resources when a high-priority
      request is pending.

      Compressed headers: Clients today send a significant amount of
      redundant data in the form of HTTP headers.  Because a single web
      page may require 50 or 100 subrequests, this data is significant.

      Server pushed streams: Server Push enables content to be pushed
      from servers to clients without a request.

   SPDY attempts to preserve the existing semantics of HTTP.  All
   features such as cookies, ETags, Vary headers, Content-Encoding
   negotiations, etc work as they do with HTTP; SPDY only replaces the
   way the data is written to the network.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Document Organization</span>

   The SPDY Specification is split into two parts: a framing layer
   (<a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>), which multiplexes a single TCP connection into
   independent frames of various types; and an HTTP layer (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>),
   which specifies the mechanism for expressing HTTP interactions using
   the framing layer.  While some of the framing layer concepts are
   isolated from HTTP, building a generic framing layer has not been a

   goal.  The framing layer is tailored to the needs of the HTTP
   protocol and server push.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Conventions and Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=2119" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   All numeric values are in network byte order.  Values are unsigned
   unless otherwise indicated.  Literal values are provided in decimal
   or hexadecimal as appropriate.  Hexadecimal literals are prefixed
   with "0x" to distinguish them from decimal literals.

   The following terms are used:

   client:  The endpoint initiating the SPDY connection.

   connection:  A transport-level connection between two endpoints.

   endpoint:  Either the client or server of the connection.

   frame:  The smallest unit of communication within an SPDY connection,
      consisting of a header and a variable-length sequence of bytes
      structured according to the frame type.

   peer:  An endpoint.  When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer"
      refers to the endpoint that is remote to the primary subject of
      discussion.

   receiver:  An endpoint that is receiving frames.

   sender:  An endpoint that is transmitting frames.

   server:  The endpoint which did not initiate the SPDY connection.

   connection error:  An error on the SPDY connection.

   stream:  A bi-directional flow of frames across a virtual channel
      within the SPDY connection.

   stream error:  An error on the individual SPDY stream.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                         June 2013</span>


<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Connection</span>

   The SPDY framing layer runs atop a reliable transport layer such as
   TCP [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>].  The client is the TCP connection initiator.  SPDY
   connections are persistent connections.

   For best performance, it is expected that non-battery operated
   clients will leave open connections until the user navigates away
   from all web pages referencing the connection, or until the server
   closes the connection.  Servers are encouraged to leave connections
   open for as long as possible, but can terminate idle connections if
   necessary.  When either endpoint closes the transport-level
   connection, it MUST first send a GOAWAY (<a href="#section-2.7.8">Section 2.7.8</a>) frame so that
   the endpoints can reliably determine if requests finished before the
   close.  It is expected that battery-operated clients may have more
   involved heuristics as to when a connection should be closed.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Connection Header</span>

   Upon establishment of a TCP connection and determination that SPDY
   will be used by both peers to communicate, each endpoint MUST send a
   connection header as a final confirmation and to establish the
   default parameters for the SPDY connection.

   The client connection header is a sequence of 24 octets (in hex
   notation)

   464f4f202a20485454502f322e300d0a0d0a42410d0a0d0a

   (the string "FOO * HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nBA\r\n\r\n") followed by a
   SETTINGS frame (<a href="#section-2.7.5">Section 2.7.5</a>).  The client sends the client
   connection header immediately upon receipt of a 101 Switching
   Protocols response (indicating a successful upgrade), or after
   receiving a TLS Finished message from the server.  If starting an
   SPDY connection with prior knowledge of server support for the
   protocol, the client connection header is sent upon connection
   establishment.

      The client connection header is selected so that a large
      proportion of HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0 servers and intermediaries do
      not attempt to process further frames.  Note that this does not
      address the concerns raised in [<a href="#ref-TALKING" title='"Talking to Yourself for Fun and Profit"'>TALKING</a>].

   The server connection header consists of just a SETTINGS frame
   (<a href="#section-2.7.5">Section 2.7.5</a>) that MUST be the first frame the server sends in the
   SPDY connection.

   To avoid unnecessary latency, clients are permitted to send

   additional frames to the server immediately after sending the client
   connection header, without waiting to receive the server connection
   header.  It is important to note, however, that the server connection
   header SETTINGS frame might include parameters that necessarily alter
   how a client is expected to communicate with the server.  Upon
   receiving the SETTINGS frame, the client is expected to honor any
   parameters established.

   Clients and servers MUST terminate the TCP connection if either peer
   does not begin with a valid connection header.  A GOAWAY frame
   (<a href="#section-2.7.8">Section 2.7.8</a>) MAY be omitted if it is clear that the peer is not
   using SPDY.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Framing</span>

   Once the SPDY connection is established, clients and servers can
   begin exchanging frames.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a>.  Frame Header</span>

   SPDY frames share a common base format consisting of an 8-byte header
   followed by 0 to 65535 bytes of data.

    0                   1                   2                   3

                               Frame Header

   The fields of the frame header are defined as:

   Length:  The length of the frame data expressed as an unsigned 16-bit
      integer.  The 8 bytes of the frame header are not included in this
      value.

   Type:  The 8-bit type of the frame.  The frame type determines how
      the remainder of the frame header and data are interpreted.
      Implementations MUST ignore unsupported and unrecognized frame
      types.

   Flags:  An 8-bit field reserved for frame-type specific boolean
      flags.

      The least significant bit (0x1) - the FINAL bit - is defined for
      all frame types as an indication that this frame is the last the
      endpoint will send for the identified stream.  Setting this flag
      causes the stream to enter the half-closed state (<a href="#section-2.4.3">Section 2.4.3</a>).
      Implementations MUST process the FINAL bit for all frames whose
      stream identifier field is not 0x0.  The FINAL bit MUST NOT be set
      on frames that use a stream identifier of 0.

      The remaining flags can be assigned semantics specific to the
      indicated frame type.  Flags that have no defined semantics for a
      particular frame type MUST be ignored, and MUST be left unset (0)
      when sending.

   R: A reserved 1-bit field.  The semantics of this bit are undefined
      and the bit MUST remain unset (0) when sending and MUST be ignored
      when receiving.

   Stream Identifier:  A 31-bit stream identifier (see <a href="#section-2.4.1">Section 2.4.1</a>).
      A value 0 is reserved for frames that are associated with the
      connection as a whole as opposed to an individual stream.

   The structure and content of the remaining frame data is dependent
   entirely on the frame type.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a>.  Frame Size</span>

   Implementations with limited resources might not be capable of
   processing large frame sizes.  Such implementations MAY choose to
   place additional limits on the maximum frame size.  However, all
   implementations MUST be capable of receiving and processing frames
   containing at least 8192 octets of data. [[anchor5: Ed.  Question:
   Does this minimum include the 8-byte header or just the frame data?]]

   An implementation MUST terminate a stream immediately if it is unable
   to process a frame due it's size.  This is done by sending an
   RST_STREAM frame (<a href="#section-2.7.4">Section 2.7.4</a>) containing the FRAME_TOO_LARGE error
   code.

   [[anchor6: : Need a way to signal the maximum frame size; no way to
   RST_STREAM on non-stream-related frames.]]Issue 28 [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Streams</span>

   A "stream" is an independent, bi-directional sequence of frames
   exchanged between the client and server within a SPDY connection.



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013                [Page 8]</span>

   Streams have several important characteristics:

   o  Streams can be established and used unilaterally or shared by
      either the client or server.

   o  Streams can be rejected or cancelled by either endpoint.

   o  Multiple types of frames can be sent by either endpoint within a
      single stream.

   o  The order in which frames are sent within a stream is significant.
      Recipients are required to process frames in the order they are
      received.

   o  Streams optionally carry a set of name-value header pairs that are
      expressed within the headers block of HEADERS+PRIORITY, HEADERS,
      or PUSH_PROMISE frames.

   o  A single SPDY connection can contain multiple concurrently active
      streams, with either endpoint interleaving frames from multiple
      streams.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.4.1">2.4.1</a>.  Stream Creation</span>

   There is no coordination or shared action between the client and
   server required to create a stream.  Rather, new streams are
   established by sending a frame whose stream identifier field
   references a previously unused stream identifier.

   All streams are identified by an unsigned 31-bit integer.  Streams
   initiated by a client use odd numbered stream identifiers; those
   initiated by the server use even numbered stream identifiers.  A
   stream identifier of zero MUST NOT be used to establish a new stream.

   The identifier of a newly established stream MUST be numerically
   greater than all previously established streams from that endpoint
   within the SPDY connection, unless the identifier has been reserved
   using a PUSH_PROMISE (<a href="#section-2.7.6">Section 2.7.6</a>) frame.  An endpoint that
   receives an unexpected stream identifier MUST respond with a
   connection error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   A peer can limit the total number of concurrently active streams
   using the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameters within a
   SETTINGS frame.  The maximum concurrent streams setting is specific
   to each endpoint and applies only to the peer.  That is, clients
   specify the maximum number of concurrent streams the server can
   initiate, and servers specify the maximum number of concurrent
   streams the client can initiate.  Peer endpoints MUST NOT exceed this



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013                [Page 9]</span>
</pre><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-10" id="page-10" href="#page-10" class="invisible"> </a>

   limit.  All concurrently active streams initiated by an endpoint,
   including streams that are half-open (<a href="#section-2.4.3">Section 2.4.3</a>) in any
   direction, count toward that endpoint's limit.

   Stream identifiers cannot be reused within a connection.  Long-lived
   connections can cause an endpoint to exhaust the available range of
   stream identifiers.  A client that is unable to establish a new
   stream identifier can establish a new connection for new streams.

   Either endpoint can request the early termination of an unwanted
   stream by sending an RST_STREAM frame (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) with an error
   code of either REFUSED_STREAM (if no frames have been processed) or
   CANCEL (if at least one frame has been processed).  Such termination
   might not take effect immediately as the peer might have sent
   additional frames on the stream prior to receiving the termination
   request.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.4.2">2.4.2</a>.  Stream priority</span>

   The endpoint establishing a new stream can assign a priority for the
   stream.  Priority is represented as an unsigned 31-bit integer. 0
   represents the highest priority and 2-1 represents the lowest
   priority.

   The purpose of this value is to allow the initiating endpoint to
   request that frames for the stream be processed with higher priority
   relative to any other concurrently active streams.  That is, if an
   endpoint receives interleaved frames for multiple streams, the
   endpoint ought to make a best-effort attempt at processing frames for
   higher priority streams before processing those for lower priority
   streams.

   Explicitly setting the priority for a stream does not guarantee any
   particular processing order for the stream relative to any other
   stream.  Nor is there is any mechanism provided by which the
   initiator of a stream can force or require a receiving endpoint to
   process frames from one stream before processing frames from another.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.4.3">2.4.3</a>.  Stream half-close</span>

   When an endpoint sends a frame for a stream with the FINAL flag set,
   the stream is considered to be half-closed for that endpoint.
   Subsequent frames MUST NOT be sent by that endpoint for the half
   closed stream for the remaining duration of the SPDY connection.
   When both endpoints have sent frames with the FINAL flag set, the
   stream is considered to be fully closed.

   If an endpoint receives additional frames for a stream that was

   previously half-closed by the sending peer, the recipient MUST
   respond with a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type STREAM_CLOSED.

   An endpoint that has not yet half-closed a stream by sending the
   FINAL flag can continue sending frames on the stream.

   It is not necessary for an endpoint to half-close a stream for which
   it has not sent any frames.  This allows endpoints to use fully
   unidirectional streams that do not require explicit action or
   acknowledgement from the receiver.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.4.4">2.4.4</a>.  Stream close</span>

   Streams can be terminated in the following ways:

   Normal termination:  Normal stream termination occurs when both
      client and server have half-closed the stream by sending a frame
      containing a FINAL flag (<a href="#section-2.3.1">Section 2.3.1</a>).

   Half-close on unidirectional stream:  A stream that only has frames
      sent in one direction can be tentatively considered to be closed
      once a frame containing a FINAL flag is sent.  The active sender
      on the stream MUST be prepared to receive frames after closing the
      stream.

   Abrupt termination:  Either peer can send a RST_STREAM control frame
      at any time to terminate an active stream.  RST_STREAM contains an
      error code to indicate the reason for termination.  A RST_STREAM
      indicates that the sender will transmit no further data on the
      stream and that the receiver is advised to cease transmission on
      it.

      The sender of a RST_STREAM frame MUST allow for frames that have
      already been sent by the peer prior to the RST_STREAM being
      processed.  If in-transit frames alter connection state, these
      frames cannot be safely discarded.  See Stream Error Handling
      (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) for more details.

   TCP connection teardown:  If the TCP connection is torn down while
      un-closed streams exist, then the endpoint MUST assume that the
      stream was abnormally interrupted and may be incomplete.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Error Handling</span>

   SPDY framing permits two classes of error:

   o  An error condition that renders the entire connection unusable is
      a connection error.



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013               [Page 11]</span>

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                         June 2013</span>


   o  An error in an individual stream is a stream error.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.5.1">2.5.1</a>.  Connection Error Handling</span>

   A connection error is any error which prevents further processing of
   the framing layer or which corrupts any connection state.

   An endpoint that encounters a connection error MUST first send a
   GOAWAY (<a href="#section-2.7.8">Section 2.7.8</a>) frame with the stream identifier of the last
   stream that it successfully received from its peer.  The GOAWAY frame
   includes an error code that indicates why the connection is
   terminating.  After sending the GOAWAY frame, the endpoint MUST close
   the TCP connection.

   It is possible that the GOAWAY will not be reliably received by the
   receiving endpoint.  In the event of a connection error, GOAWAY only
   provides a best-effort attempt to communicate with the peer about why
   the connection is being terminated.

   An endpoint can end a connection at any time.  In particular, an
   endpoint MAY choose to treat a stream error as a connection error if
   the error is recurrent.  Endpoints SHOULD send a GOAWAY frame when
   ending a connection, as long as circumstances permit it.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a>.  Stream Error Handling</span>

   A stream error is an error related to a specific stream identifier
   that does not affect processing of other streams at the framing
   layer.

   An endpoint that detects a stream error sends a RST_STREAM
   (<a href="#section-2.7.4">Section 2.7.4</a>) frame that contains the stream identifier of the
   stream where the error occurred.  The RST_STREAM frame includes an
   error code that indicates the type of error.

   A RST_STREAM is the last frame that an endpoint can send on a stream.
   The peer that sends the RST_STREAM frame MUST be prepared to receive
   any frames that were sent or enqueued for sending by the remote peer.
   These frames can be ignored, except where they modify connection
   state (such as the state maintained for header compression
   (<a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>)).

   Normally, an endpoint SHOULD NOT send more than one RST_STREAM frame
   for any stream.  However, an endpoint MAY send additional RST_STREAM
   frames if it receives frames on a closed stream after more than a
   round trip time.  This behavior is permitted to deal with misbehaving
   implementations.

   An endpoint MUST NOT send a RST_STREAM in response to an RST_STREAM
   frame, to avoid looping.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.5.3">2.5.3</a>.  Error Codes</span>

   Error codes are 32-bit fields that are used in RST_STREAM and GOAWAY
   frames to convey the reasons for the stream or connection error.

   Error codes share a common code space.  Some error codes only apply
   to specific conditions and have no defined semantics in certain frame
   types.

   The following error codes are defined:

   NO_ERROR (0):  The associated condition is not as a result of an
      error.  For example, a GOAWAY might include this code to indicate
      graceful shutdown of a connection.

   PROTOCOL_ERROR (1):  The endpoint detected an unspecific protocol
      error.  This error is for use when a more specific error code is
      not available.

   INTERNAL_ERROR (2):  The endpoint encountered an unexpected internal
      error.

   FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR (3):  The endpoint detected that its peer violated
      the flow control protocol.

   INVALID_STREAM (4):  The endpoint received a frame for an inactive
      stream.

   STREAM_CLOSED (5):  The endpoint received a frame after a stream was
      half-closed.

   FRAME_TOO_LARGE (6):  The endpoint received a frame that was larger
      than the maximum size that it supports.

   REFUSED_STREAM (7):  The endpoint is refusing the stream before
      processing its payload.

   CANCEL (8):  Used by the creator of a stream to indicate that the
      stream is no longer needed.

   additional metadata.

   At the group level, a map of token-index to key-pair is maintained
   for each defined group.  There is no persistent mapping from
   stream-id to header-group, instead each HeaderBlock includes
   reference to the HeaderGroup that will be used in this particular set
   of metadata.

   The HeaderBlock compressor (described later) is subject to the
   following constraints:

      TotalHeaderStorageSize : default(16k)

      MaxHeaderGroups: default(1)

      MaxValEntries: default(64)

   It is expected that either party will set these to larger values
   immediately upon connection establishment using the SETTINGS frame.

   A stream with a HeaderBlock which declares that it is using
   HeaderGroup 'G' would use the following algorithm to interpret its
   meta-data.

               def compute_headers(stream):
               headers = {}
               for index in stream_group[G]:
               headers[lru_lookup[index].key] = lru_lookup[index].val)
               for {key, value} in ephemereal_headers_from_HeaderBlock:
               headers[key] = value
               return headers

   A smart implementation will be able to interpret a headers frame
   without reconstructing the headers, and thus be able to represent and
   interpret headers with less memory and CPU.

   The Name/Value Header Block is found in the HEADERS+PRIORITY,
   HEADERS, and PUSH_PROMISE control frames, and shares a common format:

               0        1        2          3..N       N+1..K

                 +--------+--------+=========+

   HG: (Header Group) An 8 bit unsigned integer specifying the header
   group for this set of headers.

   Ops: A number of operations.  Operations will be detailed below.

   The Opcode field indicates the type of operation.

      0x0 (reserved) -- this is not used and is reserved in case a
      token-based delimiter is required in the future.

      0x1 (Toggle) indicates that the data which follows will be an lru-
      index.  That lru-index, if present in the current header-group
      will be removed from the header group.  If it is not present in
      the current header group, it will be added to the current header
      group.  This opcode thus affects what parts of the data stored in
      the LRU are interpreted as being visible in the current set of
      headers for whatever frame includes the HeaderBlock

      0x1 (Clone) indicates that the data which follows will be a key-
      index and a string literal.  The key-index is used to refer to a
      pre-existing key, and thus the operation results in the storing of
      the pre-existing key and the new value.  The key-value will be
      appended to the LRU, and the index in the LRU added to the current
      header group.

      0x2 (KVSto) indicates that the data which follows will be two
      string literals.  The first such string represents a new key to be
      stored, and the second such string represents a value.  As with
      Clone, the key-value will be stored in the LRU with a new index,
      and that index will be added to the current header group.

      0x2 (Eref) indicates that the data which follows will be two
      string literals.  The first such string represents key, and the
      second string represents a value.  Unlike KVSto, the Eref does not
      modify the compressor state-- it only specified a key-value which
      will be interpreted as being part of the meta-data for the frame
      which includes the HeaderBlock.

   String are always encoded as a single bit, followed by data.  If that
   bit is '0', then what follows is 7-bit us-ascii, null-terminated.  If
   that bit is '1', then it is huffman encoded using a canonical
   huffman-code and ends with an 'eof' character (which is not part of
   the string).  If the last bit of the EOF is not immediately before
   the byte boundary, the remaining bits of that byte are padded with
   zero.  Strings in a request are encoded with a different huffman-
   encoder than strings in a response, as the frequency of occurance in

   these differ by quite a bit.

              A string is either:
              +-|============================|====================|--------+
              |1| huffman-encoded-characters | huffman-eof-symbol |pad-bits|

              or

              +-|-------+========+--------+
              |0|  7 bit-ascii   |00000000|
              +-|-------+========+--------+

   The NumOps field encodes one minus the number of operations that
   follow.  Since the field-width is 8 bits, a maximum of 256 ops can be
   represented.  If more than 256 operations are required, simply repeat
   doing this until all operations have been encoded.  It is expected
   that this will be extremely rare.

              2: "user-agent", "blah blah browser version blah blah"
              3: "accept-encoding", "sdch, bzip, compress"

              The stream-group table for group zero looks like this:
              0: ":host", "www.foo.com"
              1: "cookie", "SOMELONGSTRINGHTATISMOSTLYOPAQUE;FOOBLA"
              2: ":path", "/somepate.html"
              Both the path and the date have changed.

              Request 3 (on stream 5) would look like the following if forwarded on HTTP/1.1:
              GET /somepage.html HTTP/1.1
              host: www.foo.com
              date: Wed Jul 18 11:50:44 2012

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.7">2.7</a>.  Frame Types</span>

   This specification defines a number of frame types, each identified
   by a unique 8-bit type code.  Each frame type serves a distinct
   purpose either in the establishment and management of the connection
   as a whole, or of individual streams.

   The transmission of specific frame types can alter the state of a
   connection.  If endpoints fail to maintain a synchronized view of the
   connection state, successful communication within the connection will
   no longer be possible.  Therefore, it is important that endpoints
   have a shared comprehension of how the state is affected by the use
   any given frame.  Accordingly, while it is expected that new frame
   types will be introduced by extensions to this protocol, only frames
   defined by this document are permitted to alter the connection state.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.1">2.7.1</a>.  DATA Frames</span>

   DATA frames (type=0x0) convey arbitrary, variable-length sequences of
   octets associated with a stream.  One or more DATA frames are used,
   for instance, to carry HTTP request or response payloads.

   The DATA frame defines the following flag:

   MSG_DONE (0x2):  Bit 2 being set signifies that this frame represents
      the last frame of a message.  This is relevant for layering of
      message-based protocols on top of SPDY.

   DATA frames MUST be associated with a stream.  If a DATA frame is
   received whose stream identifier field is 0x0, the recipient MUST
   respond with a connection error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.2">2.7.2</a>.  HEADERS+PRIORITY</span>

   The HEADERS+PRIORITY frame (type=0x1) allows the sender to set header
   fields and stream priority at the same time.

    0                   1                   2                   3

                      HEADERS+PRIORITY Frame Payload

   The HEADERS+PRIORITY frame is identical to the HEADERS frame
   (<a href="#section-2.7.9">Section 2.7.9</a>), preceded by a single reserved bit and a 31-bit
   priority; see <a href="#section-2.4.2">Section 2.4.2</a>.

   HEADERS+PRIORITY uses the same flags as the HEADERS frame, except
   that a HEADERS+PRIORITY frame with a CONTINUES bit MUST be followed
   by another HEADERS+PRIORITY frame.  See HEADERS frame (<a href="#section-2.7.9">Section 2.7.9</a>)
   for any flags.

   HEADERS+PRIORITY frames MUST be associated with a stream.  If a
   HEADERS+PRIORITY frame is received whose stream identifier field is
   0x0, the recipient MUST respond with a connection error
   (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The HEADERS+PRIORITY frame modifies the connection state as defined
   in <a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.3">2.7.3</a>.  PRIORITY</span>

   The PRIORITY frame (type=0x2) specifies the sender-advised priority

                          PRIORITY Frame Payload

   The payload of a PRIORITY frame contains a single reserved bit and a
   31-bit priority.

   The PRIORITY frame is associated with an existing stream.  If a
   PRIORITY frame is received with a stream identifier of 0x0, the
   recipient MUST respond with a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.4">2.7.4</a>.  RST_STREAM</span>

   The RST_STREAM frame (type=0x3) allows for abnormal termination of a
   stream.  When sent by the initiator of a stream, it indicates that
   they wish to cancel the stream.  When sent by the receiver of a
   stream, it indicates that either the receiver is rejecting the
   stream, requesting that the stream be cancelled or that an error
   condition has occurred.

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                         RST_STREAM Frame Payload

   The RST_STREAM frame contains a single unsigned, 32-bit integer
   identifying the error code (<a href="#section-2.5.3">Section 2.5.3</a>).  The error code indicates
   why the stream is being terminated.

   No type-flags are defined.

   The RST_STREAM frame fully terminates the referenced stream and
   causes it to enter the closed state.  After receiving a RST_STREAM on
   a stream, the receiver MUST NOT send additional frames for that

   stream.  However, after sending the RST_STREAM, the sending endpoint
   MUST be prepared to receive and process additional frames sent on the
   stream that might have been sent by the peer prior to the arrival of
   the RST_STREAM.

   RST_STREAM frames MUST be associated with a stream.  If a RST_STREAM
   frame is received whose stream identifier field is 0x0 the recipient
   MUST respond with a connection error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.5">2.7.5</a>.  SETTINGS</span>

   The SETTINGS frame (type=0x4) conveys configuration parameters that
   affect how endpoints communicate.  The parameters are either
   constraints on peer behavior or preferences.

   SETTINGS frames MUST be sent at the start of a connection, and MAY be
   sent at any other time by either endpoint over the lifetime of the
   connection.

   Implementations MUST support all of the settings defined by this
   specification and MAY support additional settings defined by
   extensions.  Unsupported or unrecognized settings MUST be ignored.
   New settings MUST NOT be defined or implemented in a way that
   requires endpoints to understand them in order to communicate
   successfully.

   A SETTINGS frame is not required to include every defined setting;
   senders can include only those parameters for which it has accurate
   values and a need to convey.  When multiple parameters are sent, they
   SHOULD be sent in order of numerically lowest ID to highest ID.  A
   single SETTINGS frame MUST NOT contain multiple values for the same
   ID.  If the receiver of a SETTINGS frame discovers multiple values
   for the same ID, it MUST ignore all values for that ID except the
   first one.

   Over the lifetime of a connection, an endpoint MAY send multiple
   SETTINGS frames containing previously unspecified parameters or new
   values for parameters whose values have already been established.
   Only the most recent value provided setting value applies.

   The SETTINGS frame defines the following flag:

   CLEAR_PERSISTED (0x2):  Bit 2 being set indicates a request to clear
      any previously persisted settings before processing the settings.
      Clients MUST NOT set this flag.

   SETTINGS frames always apply to a connection, never a single stream.

   The stream identifier for a settings frame MUST be zero.  If an
   endpoint receives a SETTINGS frame whose stream identifier field is
   anything other than 0x0, the endpoint MUST respond with a connection
   error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.5.1">2.7.5.1</a>.  Setting Format</span>

   The payload of a SETTINGS frame consists of zero or more settings.
   Each setting consists of an 8-bit flags field specifying per-item
   instructions, an unsigned 24-bit setting identifier, and an unsigned
   32-bit value.

                              Setting Format

   Two flags are defined for the 8-bit flags field:

   PERSIST_VALUE (0x1):  Bit 1 (the least significant bit) being set
      indicates a request from the server to the client to persist this
      setting.  A client MUST NOT set this flag.

   PERSISTED (0x2):  Bit 2 being set indicates that this setting is a
      persisted setting being returned by the client to the server.
      This also indicates that this setting is not a client setting, but
      a value previously set by the server.  A server MUST NOT set this
      flag.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.5.2">2.7.5.2</a>.  Setting Persistence</span>

   [[anchor10: Note that persistence of settings is under discussion in
   the WG and might be removed in a future version of this document.]]

   A server endpoint can request that configuration parameters sent to a
   client in a SETTINGS frame are to be persisted by the client across
   SPDY connections and returned to the server in any new SETTINGS frame
   the client sends to the server in the current connection or any
   future connections.

   Persistence is requested on a per-setting basis by setting the
   PERSIST_VALUE flag (0x1).




<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013               [Page 24]</span>

   Client endpoints are not permitted to make such requests.  Servers
   MUST ignore any attempt by clients to request that a server persist
   configuration parameters.

   Persistence of configuration parameters is done on a per-origin basis
   (see [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6454" title='"The Web Origin Concept"'>RFC6454</a>]).  That is, when a client establishes a connection
   with a server, and the server requests that the client maintain
   persistent settings, the client SHOULD return the persisted settings
   on all future connections to the same origin, IP address and TCP
   port.

   Whenever the client sends a SETTINGS frame in the current connection,
   or establishes a new connection with the same origin, persisted
   configuration parameters are sent with the PERSISTED flag (0x2) set
   for each persisted parameter.

   Persisted settings accumulate until the server requests that all
   previously persisted settings are to be cleared by setting the
   CLEAR_PERSISTED (0x2) flag on the SETTINGS frame.

   For example, if the server sends IDs 1, 2, and 3 with the
   FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE in a first SETTINGS frame, and then sends
   IDs 4 and 5 with the FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE in a subsequent
   SETTINGS frame, the client will return values for all 5 settings (1,
   2, 3, 4, and 5 in this example) to the server.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.5.3">2.7.5.3</a>.  Defined Settings</span>

   SETTINGS_UPLOAD_BANDWIDTH (1):  indicates the sender's estimated
      upload bandwidth for this connection.  The value is an the
      integral number of kilobytes per second that the sender predicts
      as an expected maximum upload channel capacity.

   SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_BANDWIDTH (2):  indicates the sender's estimated
      download bandwidth for this connection.  The value is an integral
      number of kilobytes per second that the sender predicts as an
      expected maximum download channel capacity.

   SETTINGS_ROUND_TRIP_TIME (3):  indicates the sender's estimated
      round-trip-time for this connection.  The round trip time is
      defined as the minimum amount of time to send a control frame from
      this client to the remote and receive a response.  The value is
      represented in milliseconds.

   SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS (4):  indicates the maximum number of
      concurrent streams that the sender will allow.  This limit is
      directional: it applies to the number of streams that the sender
      permits the receiver to create.  By default there is no limit.  It

      is recommended that this value be no smaller than 100, so as to
      not unnecessarily limit parallelism.

   SETTINGS_CURRENT_CWND (5):  indicates the sender's current TCP CWND
      value.

   SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_RETRANS_RATE (6):  indicates the sender's
      retransmission rate (bytes retransmitted / total bytes
      transmitted).

   SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE (7):  indicates the sender's initial
      stream window size (in bytes) for new streams.

   SETTINGS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_VECTOR_SIZE (8):  indicates the sender's
      (which should be the server) size of the client certificate
      vector.

   SETTINGS_SUPPORTING_SCHEMES (9):  indicates the sender's supported
      overlayering protocol schemes.  The corresponding value must be a
      32-bit value, and which contains flags as follows:

         bit 0: http

         bit 1: https

         bit 2: ws

         bit 3: wss

   SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS (10):  indicates that streams directed
      to the sender will not be subject to flow control.  The least
      significant bit (0x1) is set to indicate that new streams are not
      flow controlled.  All other bits are reserved.  This setting
      applies to all streams, including existing streams.  These bits
      cannot be cleared once set, see <a href="#section-2.7.10.4">Section 2.7.10.4</a>.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.6">2.7.6</a>.  PUSH_PROMISE</span>

   The PUSH_PROMISE frame (type=0x5) is used to notify the peer endpoint

   PUSH_PROMISE frame includes the unsigned 31-bit identifier of the
   stream the endpoint plans to create along with a minimal set of
   headers that provide additional context for the stream.  <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>

                        PUSH_PROMISE Payload Format

   The payload of a PUSH_PROMISE includes a "Promised-Stream-ID".  This
   unsigned 31-bit integer identifies the stream the endpoint intends to
   start sending frames for.  The promised stream identifier MUST be a
   valid choice for the next stream sent by the sender (see new stream
   identifier (<a href="#section-2.4.1">Section 2.4.1</a>)).

   PUSH_PROMISE frames MUST be associated with an existing stream.  If
   the stream identifier field specifies the value 0x0, a recipient MUST
   respond with a connection error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The state of promised streams is bound to the state of the original
   associated stream on which the PUSH_PROMISE frame were sent.  If the
   originating stream state changes to fully closed, all associated
   promised streams fully close as well. [[anchor11: Ed.  Note: We need
   clarification on this point.  How synchronized are the lifecycles of
   streams and associated promised streams?]]

   PUSH_PROMISE uses the same flags as the HEADERS frame, except that a
   PUSH_PROMISE frame with a CONTINUES bit MUST be followed by another
   PUSH_PROMISE frame.  See HEADERS frame (<a href="#section-2.7.9">Section 2.7.9</a>) for any flags.

   Promised streams are not required to be used in order promised.  The
   PUSH_PROMISE only reserves stream identifiers for later use.

   Recipients of PUSH_PROMISE frames can choose to reject promised
   streams by returning a RST_STREAM referencing the promised stream
   identifier back to the sender of the PUSH_PROMISE.

   The PUSH_PROMISE frame modifies the connection state as defined in
   <a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.7">2.7.7</a>.  PING</span>

   The PING frame (type=0x6) is a mechanism for measuring a minimal
   round-trip time from the sender, as well as determining whether an
   idle connection is still functional.  PING frames can be sent from
   any endpoint.



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013               [Page 27]</span>
</pre><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-28" id="page-28" href="#page-28" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                         June 2013</span>


   PING frames consist of an arbitrary, variable-length sequence of
   octets.  Receivers of a PING send a response PING frame with the PONG
   flag set and precisely the same sequence of octets back to the sender
   as soon as possible.

   Processing of PING frames SHOULD be performed with the highest
   priority if there are additional frames waiting to be processed.

   The PING frame defines one type-specific flag:

   PONG (0x2):  Bit 2 being set indicates that this PING frame is a PING
      response.  An endpoint MUST set this flag in PING responses.  An
      endpoint MUST NOT respond to PING frames containing this flag.

   PING frames are not associated with any individual stream.  If a PING
   frame is received with a stream identifier field value other than
   0x0, the recipient MUST respond with a connection error
   (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.8">2.7.8</a>.  GOAWAY</span>

   The GOAWAY frame (type=0x7) informs the remote peer to stop creating
   streams on this connection.  It can be sent from the client or the
   server.  Once sent, the sender will ignore frames sent on new streams
   for the remainder of the connection.  Receivers of a GOAWAY frame
   MUST NOT open additional streams on the connection, although a new
   connection can be established for new streams.  The purpose of this
   frame is to allow an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new
   streams (perhaps for a reboot or maintenance), while still finishing
   processing of previously established streams.

   There is an inherent race condition between an endpoint starting new
   streams and the remote sending a GOAWAY frame.  To deal with this
   case, the GOAWAY contains the stream identifier of the last stream
   which was processed on the sending endpoint in this connection.  If
   the receiver of the GOAWAY used streams that are newer than the
   indicated stream identifier, they were not processed by the sender
   and the receiver may treat the streams as though they had never been
   created at all (hence the receiver may want to re-create the streams
   later on a new connection).

   Endpoints should always send a GOAWAY frame before closing a
   connection so that the remote can know whether a stream has been
   partially processed or not.  (For example, if an HTTP client sends a
   POST at the same time that a server closes a connection, the client
   cannot know if the server started to process that POST request if the
   server does not send a GOAWAY frame to indicate where it stopped
   working).

                           GOAWAY Payload Format

   The GOAWAY frame does not define any type-specific flags.

   The GOAWAY frame applies to the connection, not a specific stream.
   The stream identifier MUST be zero.

   The last stream identifier in the GOAWAY frame contains the highest
   numbered stream identifier for which the sender of the GOAWAY frame
   has received frames on and might have taken some action on.  All
   streams up to and including the identified stream might have been
   processed in some way.  The last stream identifier is set to 0 if no
   streams were processed.

      Note: In this case, "processed" means that some data from the
      stream was passed to some higher layer of software that might have
      taken some action as a result.

   On streams with lower or equal numbered identifiers that do not close
   completely prior to the connection being closed, re-attempting
   requests, transactions, or any protocol activity is not possible
   (with the exception of idempotent actions like HTTP GET, PUT, or
   DELETE).  Any protocol activity that uses higher numbered streams can
   be safely retried using a new connection.

   Activity on streams numbered lower or equal to the last stream
   identifier might still complete successfully.  The sender of a GOAWAY
   frame gracefully shut down a connection by sending a GOAWAY frame,
   maintaining the connection in an open state until all in-progress
   streams complete.

   The last stream ID MUST be 0 if no streams were acted upon.

   The GOAWAY frame also contains a 32-bit error code (<a href="#section-2.5.3">Section 2.5.3</a>)
   that contains the reason for closing the connection.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.9">2.7.9</a>.  HEADERS</span>

   The HEADERS frame (type=0x8) provides header fields for a stream.
   Any number of HEADERS frames can may be sent on an existing stream at
   any time.

   Additional type-specific flags for the HEADERS frame are:

   CONTINUES (0x2):  The CONTINUES bit indicates that this frame does
      not contain the entire payload necessary to provide a complete set
      of headers.

      The payload for a complete set of headers is provided by a
      sequence of HEADERS frames, terminated by a HEADERS frame without
      the CONTINUES bit.  Once the sequence terminates, the payload of
      all HEADERS frames are concatenated and interpreted as a single
      block.

      A HEADERS frame that includes a CONTINUES bit MUST be followed by
      a HEADERS frame for the same stream.  A receiver MUST treat the
      receipt of any other type of frame or a frame on a different
      stream as a connection error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type
      PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The payload of a HEADERS frame contains a Headers Block
   (<a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>).

   The HEADERS frame is associated with an existing stream.  If a
   HEADERS frame is received with a stream identifier of 0x0, the
   recipient MUST respond with a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The HEADERS frame changes the connection state as defined in
   <a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.10">2.7.10</a>.  WINDOW_UPDATE</span>

   The WINDOW_UPDATE frame (type=0x9) is used to implement flow control.

   Flow control operates at two levels: on each individual stream and on
   the entire connection.

   Both types of flow control are hop by hop; that is, only between the
   two endpoints.  Intermediaries do not forward WINDOW_UPDATE frames
   between dependent connections.  However, throttling of data transfer

   by any receiver can indirectly cause the propagation of flow control
   information toward the original sender.

   Flow control only applies to frames that are identified as being
   subject to flow control.  Of the frame types defined in this
   document, this includes only DATA frame.  Frames that are exempt from
   flow control MUST be accepted and processed, unless the receiver is
   unable to assign resources to handling the frame.  A receiver MAY
   respond with a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) or connection error
   (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR if it is unable accept a
   frame.

   The following additional flags are defined for the WINDOW_UPDATE
   frame:

   END_FLOW_CONTROL (0x2):  Bit 2 being set indicates that flow control
      for the identified stream or connection has been ended; subsequent
      frames do not need to be flow controlled.

   The WINDOW_UPDATE frame can be specific to a stream or to the entire
   connection.  In the former case, the frame's stream identifier
   indicates the affected stream; in the latter, the value "0" indicates
   that the entire connection is the subject of the frame.

   The payload of a WINDOW_UPDATE frame is a 32-bit value indicating the
   additional number of bytes that the sender can transmit in addition
   to the existing flow control window.  The legal range for this field
   is 1 to 2 - 1 (0x7fffffff) bytes; the most significant bit of this
   value is reserved.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.10.1">2.7.10.1</a>.  The Flow Control Window</span>

   Flow control in SPDY is implemented using a window kept by each
   sender on every stream.  The flow control window is a simple integer
   value that indicates how many bytes of data the sender is permitted
   to transmit; as such, its size is a measure of the buffering
   capability of the receiver.

   Two flow control windows are applicable; the stream flow control
   window and the connection flow control window.  The sender MUST NOT
   send a flow controlled frame with a length that exceeds the space
   available in either of the flow control windows advertised by the
   receiver.  Frames with zero length with the FINAL flag set (for
   example, an empty data frame) MAY be sent if there is no available
   space in either flow control window.

   For flow control calculations, the 8 byte frame header is not
   counted.



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013               [Page 31]</span>

   After sending a flow controlled frame, the sender reduces the space
   available in both windows by the length of the transmitted frame.

   The receiver of a frame sends a WINDOW_UPDATE frame as it consumes
   data and frees up space in flow control windows.  Separate
   WINDOW_UPDATE frames are sent for the stream and connection level
   flow control windows.

   A sender that receives a WINDOW_UPDATE frame updates the
   corresponding window by the amount specified in the frame.

   A sender MUST NOT allow a flow control window to exceed 2 - 1 bytes.
   If a sender receives a WINDOW_UPDATE that causes a flow control
   window to exceed this maximum it MUST terminate either the stream or
   the connection, as appropriate.  For streams, the sender sends a
   RST_STREAM with the error code of FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR code; for the
   connection, a GOAWAY frame with a FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR code.

   Flow controlled frames from the sender and WINDOW_UPDATE frames from
   the receiver are completely asynchronous with respect to each other.
   This property allows a receiver to aggressively update the window
   size kept by the sender to prevent streams from stalling.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.10.2">2.7.10.2</a>.  Initial Flow Control Window Size</span>

   When a SPDY connection is first established, new streams are created
   with an initial flow control window size of 65535 bytes.  The
   connection flow control window is 65536 bytes.  Both endpoints can
   adjust the initial window size for new streams by including a value
   for SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE in the SETTINGS frame that forms
   part of the connection header.

   Prior to receiving a SETTINGS frame that sets a value for
   SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE, a client can only use the default
   initial window size when sending flow controlled frames.  Similarly,
   the connection flow control window is set to the default initial
   window size until a WINDOW_UPDATE frame is received.

   A SETTINGS frame can alter the initial flow control window size for
   all current streams.  When the value of SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE
   changes, a receiver MUST adjust the size of all flow control windows
   that it maintains by the difference between the new value and the old
   value.

   A change to SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE could cause the available
   space in a flow control window to become negative.  A sender MUST
   track the negative flow control window, and MUST NOT send new flow
   controlled frames until it receives WINDOW_UPDATE frames that cause

   the flow control window to become positive.

   For example, if the server sets the initial window size to be 16KB,
   and the client sends 64KB immediately on connection establishment,
   the client will recalculate the available flow control window to be
   -48KB on receipt of the SETTINGS frame.  The client retains a
   negative flow control window until WINDOW_UPDATE frames restore the
   window to being positive, after which the client can resume sending.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.10.3">2.7.10.3</a>.  Reducing the Stream Window Size</span>

   A receiver that wishes to use a smaller flow control window than the
   current size can send a new SETTINGS frame.  However, the receiver
   MUST be prepared to receive data that exceeds this window size, since
   the sender might send data that exceeds the lower limit prior to
   processing the SETTINGS frame.

   A receiver has two options for handling streams that exceed flow
   control limits:

   1.  The receiver can immediately send RST_STREAM with
       FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR error code for the affected streams.

   2.  The receiver can accept the streams and tolerate the resulting
       head of line blocking, sending WINDOW_UPDATE frames as it
       consumes data.

   If a receiver decides to accept streams, both sides MUST recompute
   the available flow control window based on the initial window size
   sent in the SETTINGS.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.10.4">2.7.10.4</a>.  Ending Flow Control</span>

   After a receiver reads in a frame that marks the end of a stream (for
   example, a data stream with a FINAL flag set), it MUST cease
   transmission of WINDOW_UPDATE frames for that stream.  A sender is
   not obligated to maintain the available flow control window for
   streams that it is no longer sending on.

   Flow control can be disabled for all streams or the connection using
   the SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS setting.  An implementation that
   does not wish to perform flow control can use this in the initial
   SETTINGS exchange.

   Flow control can be disabled for an individual stream or the overall
   connection by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE with the END_FLOW_CONTROL flag
   set.  The payload of a WINDOW_UPDATE frame that has the
   END_FLOW_CONTROL flag set is ignored.

   Flow control cannot be enabled again once disabled.  Any attempt to
   re-enable flow control - by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE or by clearing
   the bits on the SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS setting - MUST be
   rejected with a FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR error code.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.11">2.7.11</a>.  CREDENTIAL</span>

   The CREDENTIAL control frame is used by the client to send additional
   client certificates to the server.  A SPDY client may decide to send
   requests for resources from different origins on the same SPDY
   connection if it decides that that server handles both origins.  For
   example if the IP address associated with both hostnames matches and
   the SSL server certificate presented in the initial handshake is
   valid for both hostnames.  However, because the SSL connection can
   contain at most one client certificate, the client needs a mechanism
   to send additional client certificates to the server.

   The server is required to maintain a vector of client certificates
   associated with a SPDY connection.  When the client needs to send a
   client certificate to the server, it will send a CREDENTIAL frame
   that specifies the index of the slot in which to store the
   certificate as well as proof that the client posesses the
   corresponding private key.  The initial size of this vector must be
   8.  If the client provides a client certificate during the first TLS
   handshake, the contents of this certificate must be copied into the
   first slot (index 1) in the CREDENTIAL vector, though it may be
   overwritten by subsequent CREDENTIAL frames.  The server must
   exclusively use the CREDENTIAL vector when evaluating the client
   certificates associated with an origin.  The server may change the
   size of this vector by sending a SETTINGS frame with the setting
   SETTINGS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_VECTOR_SIZE value specified.  In the
   event that the new size is smaller than the current size, truncation
   occurs preserving lower-index slots as possible.

   TLS renegotiation with client authentication is incompatible with
   SPDY given the multiplexed nature of SPDY.  Specifically, imagine
   that the client has 2 requests outstanding to the server for two
   different pages (in different tabs).  When the renegotiation + client
   certificate request comes in, the browser is unable to determine
   which resource triggered the client certificate request, in order to
   prompt the user accordingly.

   Slot: The index in the server's client certificate vector where this
   certificate should be stored.  If there is already a certificate
   stored at this index, it will be overwritten.  The index is one
   based, not zero based; zero is an invalid slot index.

   Proof: Cryptographic proof that the client has possession of the
   private key associated with the certificate.  The format is a TLS
   digitally-signed element
   (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-4.7">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-4.7</a>).  The signature
   algorithm must be the same as that used in the CertificateVerify
   message.  However, since the MD5+SHA1 signature type used in TLS 1.0
   connections can not be correctly encoded in a digitally-signed
   element, SHA1 must be used when MD5+SHA1 was used in the SSL
   connection.  The signature is calculated over a 32 byte TLS extractor
   value (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5705">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5705</a>) with a label of "EXPORTER
   SPDY certificate proof" using the empty string as context.  ForRSA
   certificates the signature would be a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.  For
   ECDSA, it would be an ECDSA-Sig-Value
   (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5480#appendix-A">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5480#appendix-A</a>).  For a 1024-bit RSA
   key, the CREDENTIAL message would be ~500 bytes.

   Certificate: The certificate chain, starting with the leaf
   certificate.  Each certificate must be encoded as a 32 bit length,
   followed by a DER encoded certificate.  The certificate must be of
   the same type (RSA, ECDSA, etc) as the client certificate associated
   with the SSL connection.

   If the server receives a request for a resource with unacceptable
   credential (either missing or invalid), it must reply with a
   RST_STREAM frame with the status code INVALID_CREDENTIALS.  Upon
   receipt of a RST_STREAM frame with INVALID_CREDENTIALS, the client
   should initiate a new stream directly to the requested origin and
   resend the request.  Note, SPDY does not allow the server to request

   If the server receives an invalid CREDENTIAL frame, it MUST respond

   SPDY is intended to be as compatible as possible with current web-
   based applications.  This means that, from the perspective of the
   server business logic or application API, the features of HTTP are
   unchanged.  To achieve this, all of the application request and
   response header semantics are preserved, although the syntax of
   conveying those semantics has changed.  Thus, the rules from HTTP/1.1
   ([<a href="#ref-HTTP-p1" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>HTTP-p1</a>], [<a href="#ref-HTTP-p2" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content"'>HTTP-p2</a>], [<a href="#ref-HTTP-p4" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests"'>HTTP-p4</a>], [<a href="#ref-HTTP-p5" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests"'>HTTP-p5</a>], [<a href="#ref-HTTP-p6" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching"'>HTTP-p6</a>], and

<span class="h3"><a name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Connection Management</span>

   Clients SHOULD NOT open more than one SPDY connection to a given
   origin ([<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6454" title='"The Web Origin Concept"'>RFC6454</a>]) concurrently.

   Note that it is possible for one SPDY connection to be finishing
   (e.g. a GOAWAY frame has been sent, but not all streams have
   finished), while another SPDY connection is starting.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  HTTP Header Fields and SPDY Headers</span>

   At the application level, HTTP uses name-value pairs in its header
   fields.  Because SPDY merges the existing HTTP header fields with
   SPDY headers, there is a possibility that some HTTP applications
   already use a particular header field name.  To avoid any conflicts,
   all header fields introduced for layering HTTP over SPDY are prefixed
   with ":". ":" is not a valid sequence in HTTP/1.* header field
   naming, preventing any possible conflict.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Request</span>

   The client initiates a request by sending a HEADERS+PRIORITY frame.
   Requests that do not contain a body MUST set the FINAL flag,
   indicating that the client intends to send no further data on this
   stream, unless the server intends to push resources (see
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>).  HEADERS+PRIORITY frame does not contain the FINAL flag
   for requests that contain a body.  The body of a request follows as a
   series of DATA frames.  The last DATA frame sets the FINAL flag to
   indicate the end of the body.

   The header fields included in the HEADERS+PRIORITY frame contain all
   of the HTTP header fields associated with an HTTP request.  The
   definitions of these headers are largely unchanged relative to
   HTTP/1.1, with a few notable exceptions:

   o  The HTTP/1.1 request-line has been split into two separate header
      fields named :method and :path, whose values specify the HTTP
      method for the request and the request-target, respectively.  The
      HTTP-version component of the request-line is removed entirely
      from the headers.

   o  The host and optional port portions of the request URI (see
      <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=3986#section-3.2">[RFC3986], Section&nbsp;3.2</a>), is specified using the new :host header
      field. [[anchor19: Ed.  Note: it needs to be clarified whether or
      not this replaces the existing HTTP/1.1 Host header.]]

   o  A new :scheme header field has been added to specify the scheme
      portion of the request-target (e.g. "https")

   o  All header field names MUST be lowercased, and the definitions of
      all header field names defined by HTTP/1.1 are updated to be all
      lowercase.

   o  The Connection, Host, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Connection, and Transfer-
      Encoding header fields are no longer valid and MUST NOT be sent.

   All HTTP Requests MUST include the ":method", ":path", ":host", and
   ":scheme" header fields.

   Header fields whose names begin with ":" (whether defined in this
   document or future extensions to this document) MUST appear before
   any other header fields.

   If a client sends a HEADERS+PRIORITY frame that omits a mandatory

   If a server receives a request where the sum of the data frame
   payload lengths does not equal the size of the Content-Length header
   field, the server MUST return a 400 (Bad Request) error.

   Although POSTs are inherently chunked, POST requests SHOULD also be
   accompanied by a Content-Length header field.  First, it informs the
   server of how much data to expect, which the server can use to track
   overall progress and provide appropriate user feedback.  More
   importantly, some HTTP server implementations fail to correctly
   process requests that omit the Content-Length header field.  Many

   existing clients send a Content-Length header field, and some server
   implementations have come to depend upon its presence.

   A client provides priority in requests as a hint to the server.  A
   server SHOULD attempt to provide responses to higher priority
   requests before lower priority requests.  A server could send lower
   priority responses during periods that higher priority responses are
   unavailable to ensure better utilization of a connection.

   If the server receives a data frame prior to a HEADERS+PRIORITY frame
   the server MUST treat this as a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>.  Response</span>

   The server responds to a client request using the same stream
   identifier that was used by the request.  An HTTP response begins
   with a HEADERS frame.  An HTTP response body consists of a series of
   DATA frames.  The last data frame contains a FINAL flag to indicate
   the end of the response.  A response that contains no body (such as a
   204 or 304 response) consists only of a HEADERS frame that contains
   the FINAL flag to indicate no further data will be sent on the
   stream.

      The response status line is unfolded into name-value pairs like
      other HTTP header fields and must be present:

      ":status":  The HTTP response status code (e.g. "200" or "200 OK")

      All header field names starting with ":" (whether defined in this
      document or future extensions to this document) MUST appear before
      any other header fields.

      All header field names MUST be all lowercase.

      The Connection, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Connection, and Transfer-
      Encoding header fields are not valid and MUST NOT be sent.

      Responses MAY be accompanied by a Content-Length header field for
      advisory purposes.  This allows clients to learn the full size of
      an entity prior to receiving all the data frames.  This can help
      in, for example, reporting progress.

      If a client receives a response where the sum of the data frame
      payload length does not equal the size of the Content-Length
      header field, the client MUST ignore the content length header
      field. [[anchor21: Ed: See.]]issue 46 [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]

   If a client receives a response with an absent or duplicated status
   header, the client MUST treat this as a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>)
   of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   If the client receives a data frame prior to a HEADERS frame the
   client MUST treat this as a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   Clients MUST support gzip compression.  Regardless of the value of
   the Accept-Encoding header field, a server MAY send responses with
   gzip or deflate encoding.  A compressed response MUST still bear an
   appropriate Content-Encoding header field.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  Authentication</span>

   When a client sends a request to an origin server that requires
   authentication, the server can reply with a "401 Unauthorized"
   response, and include a WWW-Authenticate challenge header that
   defines the authentication scheme to be used.  The client then
   retries the request with an Authorization header appropriate to the
   specified authentication scheme.

   There are four options for proxy authentication, Basic, Digest, NTLM
   and Negotiate (SPNEGO).  The first two options were defined in
   <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=2617">RFC2617</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=2617" title='"HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication"'>RFC2617</a>], and are stateless.  The second two options were
   developed by Microsoft and specified in <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=4559">RFC4559</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=4559" title='"SPNEGO- based Kerberos and NTLM HTTP Authentication in Microsoft Windows"'>RFC4559</a>], and are
   stateful; otherwise known as multi-round authentication, or
   connection authentication.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-3.2.4.1">3.2.4.1</a>.  Stateless Authentication</span>

   Stateless Authentication over SPDY is identical to how it is
   performed over HTTP.  If multiple SPDY streams are concurrently sent
   to a single server, each will authenticate independently, similar to
   how two HTTP connections would independently authenticate to a proxy
   server.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-3.2.4.2">3.2.4.2</a>.  Stateful Authentication</span>

   Unfortunately, the stateful authentication mechanisms were
   implemented and defined in a such a way that directly violates
   <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=2617">RFC2617</a> - they do not include a "realm" as part of the request.  This
   is problematic in SPDY because it makes it impossible for a client to
   disambiguate two concurrent server authentication challenges.

   To deal with this case, SPDY servers using Stateful Authentication
   MUST implement one of two changes:




<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013               [Page 39]</span>

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                         June 2013</span>


      Servers can add a "realm=&lt;desired realm&gt;" header so that the two
      authentication requests can be disambiguated and run concurrently.
      Unfortunately, given how these mechanisms work, this is probably
      not practical.

      Upon sending the first stateful challenge response, the server
      MUST buffer and defer all further frames which are not part of
      completing the challenge until the challenge has completed.
      Completing the authentication challenge may take multiple round
      trips.  Once the client receives a "401 Authenticate" response for
      a stateful authentication type, it MUST stop sending new requests
      to the server until the authentication has completed by receiving
      a non-401 response on at least one stream.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Server Push Transactions</span>

   SPDY enables a server to send multiple replies to a client for a
   single request.  The rationale for this feature is that sometimes a
   server knows that it will need to send multiple resources in response
   to a single request.  Without server push features, the client must
   first download the primary resource, then discover the secondary
   resource(s), and request them.

   Server push is an optional feature.  The
   SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS setting from the client limits the
   number of resources that can be concurrently pushed by a server.
   Server push can be disabled by clients that do not wish to receive
   pushed resources by advertising a SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS
   SETTING (<a href="#section-2.7.5">Section 2.7.5</a>) of zero.  This prevents servers from creating
   the streams necessary to push resources.

   Clients receiving a pushed response MUST validate that the server is
   authorized to push the resource using the same-origin policy
   ([<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6454" title='"The Web Origin Concept"'>RFC6454</a>]).  For example, a SPDY connection to "example.com" is
   generally [[anchor24: Ed: weaselly use of "generally", needs better
   definition]] not permitted to push a response for "www.example.org".

   A client that accepts pushed resources caches those resources as
   though they were responses to GET requests.

   Pushing of resources avoids the round-trip delay, but also creates a
   potential race where a server can be pushing content which a client
   is in the process of requesting.  The PUSH_PROMISE frame reduces the
   chances of this condition occurring, while retaining the performance
   benefit.

   Pushed responses are associated with a request at the SPDY framing
   layer.  The PUSH_PROMISE is sent on the stream for the associated



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013               [Page 40]</span>

   request, which allows a receiver to correlate the pushed resource
   with a request.  The pushed stream inherits all of the request header
   fields from the associated stream with the exception of resource
   identification header fields (":host", ":scheme", and ":path"), which
   are provided as part of the PUSH_PROMISE frame.

   Pushed resources always have an associated ":method" of "GET".  A
   cache MUST store these inherited and implied request header fields
   with the cached resource.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  Server implementation</span>

   NOTE(willchan): Resolve the MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS limit with HTTP2
   which deletes the text in the paragraph below.  This section will not
   be updated until we resolve that.

   When the server intends to push a resource to the user-agent, it
   promises that it will opens a new stream in the future (but not now)
   by sending a PUSH_PROMISE frame.  The PUSH_PROMISE frame MUST include
   an Associated-To-Stream-ID, Prmoised-Stream-ID, and MUST ensure that
   headers for ":scheme", ":host", ":path" representing the URL for the
   resource being pushed are either already present in the implied
   headers context (i.e. the request headers), or it must override the
   headers which do not match the pushed resource.  The ":path" MUST
   always be different from the originally request resource.  The
   stream-IDs represented in the Promised-Stream-ID field MUST NOT count
   towards the MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS limit.  When the server is ready
   to send the resource, it will send a HEADERS frame with the stream-ID
   indicated by the Promised-Stream-ID sent in the PUSH_PROMISE frame
   earlier.  As with any other HEADERS frame, subsequent headers may
   follow in other HEADERS frames.  The purpose of the association is so
   that the user-agent can differentiate which request induced the
   pushed stream; without it, if the user-agent had two tabs open to the
   same page, each pushing unique content under a fixed URL, the user-
   agent would not be able to differentiate the requests.

   The Associated-To-Stream-ID must be the ID of an existing, open
   stream.  The reason for this restriction is to have a clear endpoint
   for pushed content.  If the user-agent requested a resource on stream
   11, the server replies on stream 11.  It can push any number of
   additional streams to the client before sending a FLAG_FIN on stream
   11.  However, once the originating stream is closed no further push
   streams may be associated with it.  The pushed streams do not need to
   be closed (FIN set) before the originating stream is closed, they
   only need to be created before the originating stream closes.

   To prevent a race condition with the client, the server must only use
   the client certificate of the associated stream when pushing

   resources.

   It is illegal for a server to push a resource with the Associated-To-
   Stream-ID of 0, or with a Slot that is not 0.

   To minimize race conditions with the client, the HEADERS+PRIORITY for
   the pushed resources MUST be sent prior to sending any content which
   could allow the client to discover the pushed resource and request
   it.

   The server MUST only push resources which would have been returned
   from a GET request.

   Note: If the server does not have all of the Name/Value Response
   headers available at the time it issues the HEADERS frame for the
   pushed resource, it may later use an additional HEADERS frame to
   augment the name/value pairs to be associated with the pushed stream.
   The subsequent HEADERS frame(s) must not contain a header for
   ':host', ':scheme', or ':path' (e.g. the server can't change the
   identity of the resource to be pushed).  The HEADERS frame must not
   contain duplicate headers with a previously sent HEADERS frame.  The
   server must send a HEADERS frame including the scheme/host/port
   headers before sending any data frames on the stream.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-3.3.2">3.3.2</a>.  Client implementation</span>

   When fetching a resource the client has 3 possibilities:

   1.  the resource is not being pushed

   2.  the resource is being pushed, but the data has not yet arrived

   3.  the resource is being pushed, and the data has started to arrive

   A client SHOULD NOT issue GET requests for a resource that has been
   promised.  A client is instead advised to wait for the pushed
   resource to arrive.

   When a client receives a PUSH_PROMISE frame from the server without
   the ":host", ":scheme", and ":path" header fields, it MUST treat this
   as a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   To cancel individual server push streams, the client can issue a
   stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type CANCEL.  After receiving a
   PUSH_PROMISE frame, the client is able to cancel the pushed resource
   before receiving any frames on the promised stream.  The server
   ceases transmission of the pushed resource; if the server has not
   commenced transmission, it does not start.

   To cancel all server push streams related to a request, the client
   may issue a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type CANCEL on the
   associated-stream-id.  By cancelling that stream, the server MUST
   immediately stop sending frames for any streams with
   in-association-to for the original stream. [[anchor27: Ed: Triggering
   side-effects on stream reset is going to be problematic for the
   framing layer.  Purely from a design perspective, it's a layering
   violation.  More practically speaking, the base request stream might
   already be removed.  Special handling logic would be required.]]

   A client can choose to time out pushed streams if the server does not
   provide the resource in a timely fashion.  A stream error
   (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type CANCEL can be used to stop a timed out push.

   If the server sends a HEADERS frame containing header fields that
   duplicate values on a previous HEADERS or PUSH_PROMISE frames on the
   same stream, the client MUST treat this as a stream error
   (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   If the server sends a HEADERS frame after sending a data frame for
   the same stream, the client MAY ignore the HEADERS frame.  Ignoring
   the HEADERS frame after a data frame prevents handling of HTTP's
   trailing header fields ([<a href="#ref-HTTP-p1" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>HTTP-p1</a>]).

<span class="h4"><a name="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Frame mapping</span>

   One WebSocket frame is mapped into one proceeding SPDY HEADERS frame
   and following plural SPDY data frames.  The SPDY HEADERS frame must
   contain WebSocket frame fields and following SPDY data frames contain
   payload data.  These data frames are free to be reframed.

   This plan doesn't care about overheads.  But HEADERS frame are
   compressed by shared dictionary with other HEADERS+PRIORITY, HEADERS,
   and other PUSH_PROMISE frames in the same SPDY connection.
   Optimistically, it reduces framing overheads.

   The following name/value pairs MUST be present in SPDY HEADERS
   frames:

      ":opcode" - The WebSocket frame opcode (See <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455">RFC6455</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455" title='"The WebSocket Protocol"'>RFC6455</a>])

      ":length" - The WebSocket frame payload length in decimal (See
      <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455">RFC6455</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455" title='"The WebSocket Protocol"'>RFC6455</a>])

      ":fin" - The WebSocket frame fin (See <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455">RFC6455</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455" title='"The WebSocket Protocol"'>RFC6455</a>])

   In addition, the following OPTIONAL name/value pairs MAY be present:

      ":rsv1" - The WebSocket frame rsv1

      ":rsv2" - The WebSocket frame rsv2

      ":rsv3" - The WebSocket frame rsv3 (See <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455">RFC6455</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455" title='"The WebSocket Protocol"'>RFC6455</a>]).  These
      values must contain "0" or "1".  When a key doesn't exist, the
      value is considered to be "0".  Thus, ony enabled bits may appear
      here.

      ":masking-key" - The WebSocket frame masking-key (See <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455">RFC6455</a>
      [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455" title='"The WebSocket Protocol"'>RFC6455</a>]) in hexadecimal (e.g. "deadbeaf").  When this key/value
      exist, the WebSocket frame mask (See <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455">RFC6455</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455" title='"The WebSocket Protocol"'>RFC6455</a>]) is
      considered to be 1 and following payload data MUST be masked(See
      <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455">RFC6455</a> [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6455" title='"The WebSocket Protocol"'>RFC6455</a>]), otherwise the WebSocket frame mask is
      considered to be 0.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                         June 2013</span>


<span class="h2"><a name="section-5">5</a>.  Design Rationale and Notes</span>

   Authors' notes: The notes in this section have no bearing on the SPDY
   protocol as specified within this document, and none of these notes
   should be considered authoritative about how the protocol works.
   However, these notes may prove useful in future debates about how to
   resolve protocol ambiguities or how to evolve the protocol going
   forward.  They may be removed before the final draft.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Separation of Framing Layer and Application Layer</span>

   Readers may note that this specification sometimes blends the framing
   layer (<a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) with requirements of a specific application - HTTP
   (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).  This is reflected in the request/response nature of the
   streams, the definition of the HEADERS and compression contexts which
   are very similar to HTTP, and other areas as well.

   This blending is intentional - the primary goal of this protocol is
   to create a low-latency protocol for use with HTTP.  Isolating the
   two layers is convenient for description of the protocol and how it
   relates to existing HTTP implementations.  However, the ability to
   reuse the SPDY framing layer is a non goal.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Error handling - Framing Layer</span>

   Error handling at the SPDY layer splits errors into two groups: Those
   that affect an individual SPDY stream, and those that do not.

   When an error is confined to a single stream, but general framing is
   in tact, SPDY attempts to use the RST_STREAM as a mechanism to
   invalidate the stream but move forward without aborting the
   connection altogether.

   For errors occuring outside of a single stream context, SPDY assumes
   the entire connection is hosed.  In this case, the endpoint detecting
   the error should initiate a connection close.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  One Connection Per Domain</span>

   SPDY attempts to use fewer connections than other protocols have
   traditionally used.  The rationale for this behavior is because it is
   very difficult to provide a consistent level of service (e.g.  TCP
   slow-start), prioritization, or optimal compression when the client
   is connecting to the server through multiple channels.

   Through lab measurements, we have seen consistent latency benefits by
   using fewer connections from the client.  The overall number of
   packets sent by SPDY can be as much as 40% less than HTTP.  Handling



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013               [Page 47]</span>

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                         June 2013</span>


   large numbers of concurrent connections on the server also does
   become a scalability problem, and SPDY reduces this load.

   The use of multiple connections is not without benefit, however.
   Because SPDY multiplexes multiple, independent streams onto a single
   stream, it creates a potential for head-of-line blocking problems at
   the transport level.  In tests so far, the negative effects of head-
   of-line blocking (especially in the presence of packet loss) is
   outweighed by the benefits of compression and prioritization.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Fixed vs Variable Length Fields</span>

   SPDY favors use of fixed length 32bit fields in cases where smaller,
   variable length encodings could have been used.  To some, this seems
   like a tragic waste of bandwidth.  SPDY choses the simple encoding
   for speed and simplicity.

   The goal of SPDY is to reduce latency on the network.  The overhead
   of SPDY frames is generally quite low.  Each data frame is only an 8
   byte overhead for a 1452 byte payload (~0.6%).  At the time of this
   writing, bandwidth is already plentiful, and there is a strong trend
   indicating that bandwidth will continue to increase.  With an average
   worldwide bandwidth of 1Mbps, and assuming that a variable length
   encoding could reduce the overhead by 50%, the latency saved by using
   a variable length encoding would be less than 100 nanoseconds.  More
   interesting are the effects when the larger encodings force a packet
   boundary, in which case a round-trip could be induced.  However, by
   addressing other aspects of SPDY and TCP interactions, we believe
   this is completely mitigated.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-5.5">5.5</a>.  Compression Context(s)</span>

   When isolating the compression contexts used for communicating with
   multiple origins, we had a few choices to make.  We could have
   maintained a map (or list) of compression contexts usable for each
   origin.  The basic case is easy - each HEADERS frame would need to
   identify the context to use for that frame.  However, compression
   contexts are not cheap, so the lifecycle of each context would need
   to be bounded.  For proxy servers, where we could churn through many
   contexts, this would be a concern.  We considered using a static set
   of contexts, say 16 of them, which would bound the memory use.  We
   also considered dynamic contexts, which could be created on the fly,
   and would need to be subsequently destroyed.  All of these are
   complicated, and ultimately we decided that such a mechanism creates
   too many problems to solve.

   Alternatively, we've chosen the simple approach, which is to simply
   provide a flag for resetting the compression context.  For the common



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires December 9, 2013               [Page 48]</span>

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                         June 2013</span>


   case (no proxy), this fine because most requests are to the same
   origin and we never need to reset the context.  For cases where we
   are using two different origins over a single SPDY connection, we
   simply reset the compression state between each transition.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-5.6">5.6</a>.  Unidirectional streams</span>

   Besides providing a clear endpoint for unidirectional streams,
   Associated-To-Stream-ID also avoids the recipient of pushed streams
   from needing to send a set of empty frames (e.g. the HEADERS+PRIORITY
   w/ FLAG_FIN) to signal that it doesn't wish to send data on the
   stream.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-5.7">5.7</a>.  Data Compression</span>

   Generic compression of data portion of the streams (as opposed to
   compression of the headers) without knowing the content of the stream
   is redundant.  There is no value in compressing a stream which is
   already compressed.  Because of this, SPDY initially allowed data
   compression to be optional.  We included it because study of existing
   websites shows that many sites are not using compression as they
   should, and users suffer because of it.  We wanted a mechanism where,
   at the SPDY layer, site administrators could simply force compression
   - it is better to compress twice than to not compress.

   Overall, however, with this feature being optional and sometimes
   redundant, it was unclear if it was useful at all.  We removed it
   from the specification.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-5.8">5.8</a>.  Server Push</span>

   A subtle but important point is that server push streams must be
   declared before the associated stream is closed.  The reason for this
   is so that proxies have a lifetime for which they can discard
   information about previous streams.  If a pushed stream could
   associate itself with an already-closed stream, then endpoints would
   not have a specific lifecycle for when they could disavow knowledge
   of the streams which went before.

   where verification of content is required.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  HTTP Headers and SPDY Headers</span>

   At the application level, HTTP uses name/value pairs in its headers.
   Because SPDY merges the existing HTTP headers with SPDY headers,
   there is a possibility that some HTTP applications already use a
   particular header name.  To avoid any conflicts, all headers
   introduced for layering HTTP over SPDY are prefixed with ":". ":" is
   not a valid sequence in HTTP header naming, preventing any possible
   conflict.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Cross-Protocol Attacks</span>

   By utilizing TLS, we believe that SPDY introduces no new cross-
   protocol attacks.  TLS encrypts the contents of all transmission
   (except the handshake itself), making it difficult for attackers to
   control the data which could be used in a cross-protocol attack.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-6.4">6.4</a>.  Server Push Implicit Headers</span>

   Pushed resources do not have an associated request.  In order for
   existing HTTP cache control validations (such as the Vary header) to
   work, however, all cached resources must have a set of request
   headers.  For this reason, browsers MUST be careful to inherit
   request headers from the associated stream for the push.  This
   includes the 'Cookie' header.

<span class="h2"><a name="section-7">7</a>.  Privacy Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Long Lived Connections</span>

   SPDY aims to keep connections open longer between clients and servers
   in order to reduce the latency when a user makes a request.  The
   maintenance of these connections over time could be used to expose
   private information.  For example, a user using a browser hours after
   the previous user stopped using that browser may be able to learn
   about what the previous user was doing.  This is a problem with HTTP
   in its current form as well, however the short lived connections make
   it less of a risk.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  SETTINGS frame</span>

   The SPDY SETTINGS frame allows servers to store out-of-band
   transmitted information about the communication between client and
   server on the client.  Although this is intended only to be used to
   reduce latency, renegade servers could use it as a mechanism to store
   identifying information about the client in future requests.

   Clients implementing privacy modes, such as Google Chrome's

<span class="h3"><a name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Supporting scheme negotiation using SETTINGS frame</span>

   By default, a client can send HEADERS+PRIORITY frames on http and
   https schemes, but if it want to send them on other schemes, it MUST
   wait for a server sending SETTINGS frame which specify declaring
   schemes.  Thus, a server SHOULD send a SETTINGS frame as soon as
   possible whether it supports other schemes or not.

<span class="h2"><a name="section-9">9</a>.  Incompatibilities with SPDY draft #3</span>

   Here is a list of the major changes between this draft #3 and this
   draft

      DONE: Different, more precise, notation style used to describe all
      frames.

      DONE: Downsizing various fields in all messages... this will
      definitely need debate

      DONE: Removal of Version field from all messages.

      DONE: Reordered fields in all messages.  All messages now share a
      common header of: length, flags, control-bit, 31-bit-payload.  All
      control frames include an 8th byte, which is the opcode.

      DONE: Addition of end-of-message delimiter flag in data frames

      DONE: Modification of server push; addition of PUSH_PROMISE frame
      add a push frame, removed the 'associated-stream-id' field from
      SYN frame

      ONGOING: Significant modifications to how headers are transported.
      This involved changes to all frames incorporating HEADER blocks,
      and changes to the HEADER blocks themselves.

      ONGOING: Different header compression technique which uses less
      CPU for proxies and which should result in competitive compression
