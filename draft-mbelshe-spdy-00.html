Abstract

   This document describes SPDY, a protocol designed for low-latency
   transport of content over the World Wide Web. SPDY introduces two
   layers of protocol.  The lower layer is a general purpose framing
   layer which can be used atop a reliable transport (likely TCP) for
   multiplexed, prioritized, and compressed data communication of many
   concurrent streams.  The upper layer of the protocol provides HTTP-
   like semantics for compatibility with existing HTTP application
   servers.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                       August 2012</span>


<span class="h2"><a name="section-1">1</a>.  Overview</span>

   One of the bottlenecks of HTTP implementations is that HTTP relies on
   multiple connections for concurrency.  This causes several problems,
   including additional round trips for connection setup, slow-start
   delays, and connection rationing by the client, where it tries to
   avoid opening too many connections to any single server.  HTTP
   pipelining helps some, but only achieves partial multiplexing.  In
   addition, pipelining has proven non-deployable in existing browsers
   due to intermediary interference.

   SPDY adds a framing layer for multiplexing multiple, concurrent
   streams across a single TCP connection (or any reliable transport
   stream).  The framing layer is optimized for HTTP-like request-
   response streams, such that applications which run over HTTP today
   can work over SPDY with little or no change on behalf of the web
   application writer.

   The SPDY connection offers four improvements over HTTP:

      Multiplexed requests: There is no limit to the number of requests
      that can be issued concurrently over a single SPDY connection.

      Prioritized requests: Clients can request certain resources to be
      delivered first.  This avoids the problem of congesting the
      network channel with non-critical resources when a high-priority
      request is pending.

      Compressed headers: Clients today send a significant amount of
      redundant data in the form of HTTP headers.  Because a single web
      page may require 50 or 100 subrequests, this data is significant.

      Server pushed streams: Server Push enables content to be pushed
      from servers to clients without a request.

   SPDY attempts to preserve the existing semantics of HTTP.  All
   features such as cookies, ETags, Vary headers, Content-Encoding
   negotiations, etc work as they do with HTTP; SPDY only replaces the
   way the data is written to the network.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Document Organization</span>

   The SPDY Specification is split into two parts: a framing layer
   (<a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>), which multiplexes a TCP connection into independent,
   length-prefixed frames, and an HTTP layer (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>), which
   specifies the mechanism for overlaying HTTP request/response pairs on
   top of the framing layer.  While some of the framing layer concepts
   are isolated from the HTTP layer, building a generic framing layer

   has not been a goal.  The framing layer is tailored to the needs of
   the HTTP protocol and server push.

      client: The endpoint initiating the SPDY connection.

      connection: A transport-level connection between two endpoints.

      endpoint: Either the client or server of a connection.

      frame: A header-prefixed sequence of bytes sent over a SPDY
      connection.

      server: The endpoint which did not initiate the SPDY connection.

      connection error: An error on the SPDY connection.

      stream: A potentially bi-directional flow of bytes across a
      virtual channel within a SPDY connection.

<span class="h2"><a name="section-2">2</a>.  SPDY Framing Layer</span>

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Connection</span>

   The SPDY framing layer runs atop a reliable transport layer such as
   TCP [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=0793">RFC0793</a>].  The client is the TCP connection initiator.  SPDY
   connections are persistent connections.

   For best performance, it is expected that non-battery operated
   clients will leave open connections until the user navigates away
   from all web pages referencing the connection, or until the server
   closes the connection.  Servers are encouraged to leave connections
   open for as long as possible, but can terminate idle connections if
   necessary.  When either endpoint closes the transport-level
   connection, it MUST first send a GOAWAY (<a href="#section-2.7.7">Section 2.7.7</a>) frame so that
   the endpoints can reliably determine if requests finished before the
   close.  It is expected that battery-operated clients may have more
   involved heuristics as to when a connection should be closed.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Connection Header</span>

   Upon establishment of a TCP connection and determination that SPDY
   will be used by both peers to communicate, each endpoint MUST send a
   connection header as a final confirmation and to establish the
   default parameters for the SPDY connection.

   The client connection header is a sequence of 25 octets (in hex
   notation)

   464f4f202a20485454502f322e300d0a0d0a42410d0a0d0a

   (the string "FOO * HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nBA\r\n\r\n") followed by a
   SETTINGS frame (<a href="#section-2.7.4">Section 2.7.4</a>).  The client sends the client
   connection header immediately upon receipt of a 101 Switching
   Protocols response (indicating a successful upgrade), or after
   receiving a TLS Finished message from the server.  If starting an
   SPDY connection with prior knowledge of server support for the
   protocol, the client connection header is sent upon connection
   establishment.

      The client connection header is selected so that a large
      proportion of HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0 servers and intermediaries do
      not attempt to process further frames.  Note that this does not
      address the concerns raised in [TALKING].

   The server connection header consists of just a SETTINGS frame
   (<a href="#section-2.7.4">Section 2.7.4</a>) that MUST be the first frame the server sends in the
   SPDY connection.

   To avoid unnecessary latency, clients are permitted to send
   additional frames to the server immediately after sending the client
   connection header, without waiting to receive the server connection
   header.  It is important to note, however, that the server connection
   header SETTINGS frame might include parameters that necessarily alter
   how a client is expected to communicate with the server.  Upon
   receiving the SETTINGS frame, the client is expected to honor any
   parameters established.

   Clients and servers MUST terminate the TCP connection if either peer
   does not begin with a valid connection header.  A GOAWAY frame
   (<a href="#section-2.7.7">Section 2.7.7</a>) MAY be omitted if it is clear that the peer is not
   using SPDY.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Framing</span>

   Once the SPDY connection is established, clients and servers can
   begin exchanging frames.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a>.  Frame Header</span>

   SPDY frames share a common base format consisting of an 8-byte header
   followed by 0 to 65535 bytes of data.

                               Frame Header

   The fields of the frame header are defined as:

   Length:  The length of the frame data expressed as an unsigned 16-bit
      integer.  The 8 bytes of the frame header are not included in this
      value.

   Type:  The 8-bit type of the frame.  The frame type determines how
      the remainder of the frame header and data are interpreted.
      Implementations MUST ignore unsupported and unrecognized frame
      types.

   Flags:  An 8-bit field reserved for frame-type specific boolean
      flags.

      The least significant bit (0x1) - the FINAL bit - is defined for
      all frame types as an indication that this frame is the last the
      endpoint will send for the identified stream.  Setting this flag
      causes the stream to enter the half-closed state (<a href="#section-2.4.3">Section 2.4.3</a>).
      Implementations MUST process the FINAL bit for all frames whose
      stream identifier field is not 0x0.  The FINAL bit MUST NOT be set
      on frames that use a stream identifier of 0.

      The remaining flags can be assigned semantics specific to the
      indicated frame type.  Flags that have no defined semantics for a
      particular frame type MUST be ignored, and MUST be left unset (0)
      when sending.

   R: A reserved 1-bit field.  The semantics of this bit are undefined
      and the bit MUST remain unset (0) when sending and MUST be ignored
      when receiving.

   Stream Identifier:  A 31-bit stream identifier (see <a href="#section-2.4.1">Section 2.4.1</a>).
      A value 0 is reserved for frames that are associated with the
      connection as a whole as opposed to an individual stream.

   The structure and content of the remaining frame data is dependent

   entirely on the frame type.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a>.  Frame Size</span>

   Implementations with limited resources might not be capable of
   processing large frame sizes.  Such implementations MAY choose to
   place additional limits on the maximum frame size.  However, all
   implementations MUST be capable of receiving and processing frames
   containing at least 8192 octets of data. [[anchor5: Ed.  Question:
   Does this minimum include the 8-byte header or just the frame data?]]

   An implementation MUST terminate a stream immediately if it is unable
   to process a frame due it's size.  This is done by sending an
   RST_STREAM frame (<a href="#section-2.7.3">Section 2.7.3</a>) containing the FRAME_TOO_LARGE error
   code.

   [[anchor6: : Need a way to signal the maximum frame size; no way to
   RST_STREAM on non-stream-related frames.]]Issue 28 [1]

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Streams</span>

   A "stream" is an independent, bi-directional sequence of frames
   exchanged between the client and server within a SPDY connection.
   Streams have several important characteristics:

   o  Streams can be established and used unilaterally or shared by
      either the client or server.

   o  Streams can be rejected or cancelled by either endpoint.

   o  Multiple types of frames can be sent by either endpoint within a
      single stream.

   o  The order in which frames are sent within a stream is significant.
      Recipients are required to process frames in the order they are
      received.

   o  Streams optionally carry a set of name-value header pairs that are
      expressed within the headers block of HEADERS+PRIORITY, HEADERS,
      or PUSH_PROMISE frames.

   o  A single SPDY connection can contain multiple concurrently active
      streams, with either endpoint interleaving frames from multiple
      streams.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.4.1">2.4.1</a>.  Stream Creation</span>

   There is no coordination or shared action between the client and
   server required to create a stream.  Rather, new streams are
   established by sending a frame whose stream identifier field
   references a previously unused stream identifier.

   All streams are identified by an unsigned 31-bit integer.  Streams
   initiated by a client use odd numbered stream identifiers; those
   initiated by the server use even numbered stream identifiers.  A
   stream identifier of zero MUST NOT be used to establish a new stream.

   The identifier of a newly established stream MUST be numerically
   greater than all previously established streams from that endpoint
   within the SPDY connection, unless the identifier has been reserved
   using a PUSH_PROMISE (<a href="#section-2.7.5">Section 2.7.5</a>) frame.  An endpoint that
   receives an unexpected stream identifier MUST respond with a
   connection error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   A peer can limit the total number of concurrently active streams
   using the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameters within a
   SETTINGS frame.  The maximum concurrent streams setting is specific
   to each endpoint and applies only to the peer.  That is, clients
   specify the maximum number of concurrent streams the server can
   initiate, and servers specify the maximum number of concurrent
   streams the client can initiate.  Peer endpoints MUST NOT exceed this
   limit.  All concurrently active streams initiated by an endpoint,
   including streams that are half-open (<a href="#section-2.4.3">Section 2.4.3</a>) in any
   direction, count toward that endpoint's limit.

   Stream identifiers cannot be reused within a connection.  Long-lived
   connections can cause an endpoint to exhaust the available range of
   stream identifiers.  A client that is unable to establish a new
   stream identifier can establish a new connection for new streams.

   Either endpoint can request the early termination of an unwanted
   stream by sending an RST_STREAM frame (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) with an error
   code of either REFUSED_STREAM (if no frames have been processed) or
   CANCEL (if at least one frame has been processed).  Such termination
   might not take effect immediately as the peer might have sent
   additional frames on the stream prior to receiving the termination
   request.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.4.2">2.4.2</a>.  Stream priority</span>

   The endpoint establishing a new stream can assign a priority for the
   stream.  Priority is represented as an unsigned 31-bit integer. 0
   represents the highest priority and 2-1 represents the lowest



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires February 2, 2013                [Page 9]</span>
</pre><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-10" id="page-10" href="#page-10" class="invisible"> </a>

   priority.

   The purpose of this value is to allow the initiating endpoint to
   request that frames for the stream be processed with higher priority
   relative to any other concurrently active streams.  That is, if an
   endpoint receives interleaved frames for multiple streams, the
   endpoint ought to make a best-effort attempt at processing frames for
   higher priority streams before processing those for lower priority
   streams.

   Explicitly setting the priority for a stream does not guarantee any
   particular processing order for the stream relative to any other
   stream.  Nor is there is any mechanism provided by which the
   initiator of a stream can force or require a receiving endpoint to
   process frames from one stream before processing frames from another.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.4.3">2.4.3</a>.  Stream half-close</span>

   When an endpoint sends a frame for a stream with the FINAL flag set,
   the stream is considered to be half-closed for that endpoint.
   Subsequent frames MUST NOT be sent by that endpoint for the half
   closed stream for the remaining duration of the SPDY connection.
   When both endpoints have sent frames with the FINAL flag set, the
   stream is considered to be fully closed.

   If an endpoint receives additional frames for a stream that was
   previously half-closed by the sending peer, the recipient MUST
   respond with a stream error (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) of type STREAM_CLOSED.

   An endpoint that has not yet half-closed a stream by sending the
   FINAL flag can continue sending frames on the stream.

   It is not necessary for an endpoint to half-close a stream for which
   it has not sent any frames.  This allows endpoints to use fully
   unidirectional streams that do not require explicit action or
   acknowledgement from the receiver.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.4.4">2.4.4</a>.  Stream close</span>

   Streams can be terminated in the following ways:

   Normal termination:  Normal stream termination occurs when both
      client and server have half-closed the stream by sending a frame
      containing a FINAL flag (<a href="#section-2.3.1">Section 2.3.1</a>).







<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires February 2, 2013               [Page 10]</span>

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                    SPDY                       August 2012</span>


   Half-close on unidirectional stream:  A stream that only has frames
      sent in one direction can be tentatively considered to be closed
      once a frame containing a FINAL flag is sent.  The active sender
      on the stream MUST be prepared to receive frames after closing the
      stream.

   Abrupt termination:  Either peer can send a RST_STREAM control frame
      at any time to terminate an active stream.  RST_STREAM contains an
      error code to indicate the reason for termination.  A RST_STREAM
      indicates that the sender will transmit no further data on the
      stream and that the receiver is advised to cease transmission on
      it.

      The sender of a RST_STREAM frame MUST allow for frames that have
      already been sent by the peer prior to the RST_STREAM being
      processed.  If in-transit frames alter connection state, these
      frames cannot be safely discarded.  See Stream Error Handling
      (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) for more details.

   TCP connection teardown:  If the TCP connection is torn down while
      un-closed streams exist, then the endpoint MUST assume that the
      stream was abnormally interrupted and may be incomplete.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Error Handling</span>

   SPDY framing permits two classes of error:

   o  An error condition that renders the entire connection unusable is
      a connection error.

   o  An error in an individual stream is a stream error.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.5.1">2.5.1</a>.  Connection Error Handling</span>

   A connection error is any error which prevents further processing of
   the framing layer or which corrupts any connection state.

   An endpoint that encounters a connection error MUST first send a
   GOAWAY (<a href="#section-2.7.7">Section 2.7.7</a>) frame with the stream identifier of the last
   stream that it successfully received from its peer.  The GOAWAY frame
   includes an error code that indicates why the connection is
   terminating.  After sending the GOAWAY frame, the endpoint MUST close
   the TCP connection.

   It is possible that the GOAWAY will not be reliably received by the
   receiving endpoint.  In the event of a connection error, GOAWAY only
   provides a best-effort attempt to communicate with the peer about why
   the connection is being terminated.



<span class="grey">Belshe &amp; Peon           Expires February 2, 2013               [Page 11]</span>

   An endpoint can end a connection at any time.  In particular, an
   endpoint MAY choose to treat a stream error as a connection error if
   the error is recurrent.  Endpoints SHOULD send a GOAWAY frame when
   ending a connection, as long as circumstances permit it.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a>.  Stream Error Handling</span>

   A stream error is an error related to a specific stream identifier
   that does not affect processing of other streams at the framing
   layer.

   An endpoint that detects a stream error sends a RST_STREAM
   (<a href="#section-2.7.3">Section 2.7.3</a>) frame that contains the stream identifier of the
   stream where the error occurred.  The RST_STREAM frame includes an
   error code that indicates the type of error.

   A RST_STREAM is the last frame that an endpoint can send on a stream.
   The peer that sends the RST_STREAM frame MUST be prepared to receive
   any frames that were sent or enqueued for sending by the remote peer.
   These frames can be ignored, except where they modify connection
   state (such as the state maintained for header compression
   (<a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>)).

   Normally, an endpoint SHOULD NOT send more than one RST_STREAM frame
   for any stream.  However, an endpoint MAY send additional RST_STREAM
   frames if it receives frames on a closed stream after more than a
   round trip time.  This behavior is permitted to deal with misbehaving
   implementations.

   An endpoint MUST NOT send a RST_STREAM in response to an RST_STREAM
   frame, to avoid looping.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.5.3">2.5.3</a>.  Error Codes</span>

   Error codes are 32-bit fields that are used in RST_STREAM and GOAWAY
   frames to convey the reasons for the stream or connection error.

   Error codes share a common code space.  Some error codes only apply
   to specific conditions and have no defined semantics in certain frame
   types.

   The following error codes are defined:

   NO_ERROR (0):  The associated condition is not as a result of an
      error.  For example, a GOAWAY might include this code to indicate
      graceful shutdown of a connection.

   PROTOCOL_ERROR (1):  The endpoint detected an unspecific protocol
      error.  This error is for use when a more specific error code is
      not available.

   INTERNAL_ERROR (2):  The endpoint encountered an unexpected internal
      error.

   FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR (3):  The endpoint detected that its peer violated
      the flow control protocol.

   INVALID_STREAM (4):  The endpoint received a frame for an inactive
      stream.

   STREAM_CLOSED (5):  The endpoint received a frame after a stream was
      half-closed.

   FRAME_TOO_LARGE (6):  The endpoint received a frame that was larger
      than the maximum size that it supports.

   REFUSED_STREAM (7):  The endpoint is refusing the stream before
      processing its payload.

   CANCEL (8):  Used by the creator of a stream to indicate that the
      stream is no longer needed.

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.6">2.6</a>.  Name/Value Header Block</span>

   A Name/Value Header Block augments the streams or group of streams
   identified by the HEADERS+PRIORITY (<a href="#section-2.7.2">Section 2.7.2</a>), HEADERS
   (<a href="#section-2.7.8">Section 2.7.8</a>), or PUSH_PROMISE (<a href="#section-2.7.5">Section 2.7.5</a>) frame stream with
   additional metadata.

   At the group level, a map of token-index to key-pair is maintained
   for each defined group.  There is no persistent mapping from
   stream-id to header-group, instead each HeaderBlock includes
   reference to the HeaderGroup that will be used in this particular set
   of metadata.

   The HeaderBlock compressor (described later) is subject to the
   following constraints:

      TotalHeaderStorageSize : default(16k)

      MaxHeaderGroups: default(1)

      MaxValEntries: default(64)

   It is expected that either party will set these to larger values

   immediately upon connection establishment using the SETTINGS frame.

   A stream with a HeaderBlock which declares that it is using
   HeaderGroup 'G' would use the following algorithm to interpret its
   meta-data.

               def compute_headers(stream):
               headers = {}
               for index in stream_group[G]:
               headers[lru_lookup[index].key] = lru_lookup[index].val)
               for {key, value} in ephemereal_headers_from_HeaderBlock:
               headers[key] = value
               return headers

   A smart implementation will be able to interpret a headers frame
   without reconstructing the headers, and thus be able to represent and
   interpret headers with less memory and CPU.

   The Name/Value Header Block is found in the HEADERS+PRIORITY,
   HEADERS, and PUSH_PROMISE control frames, and shares a common format:

               0        1        2          3..N       N+1..K
               +--------+--------+--------+=====+     +=====+

               +--------+--------+--------+=====+     +=====+

   Ops are of the form:

                 +--------+--------+=========+
                 | OpCode | NumOps | Op Args |
                 +--------+--------+=========+

   HG: (Header Group) An 8 bit unsigned integer specifying the header
   group for this set of headers.

   Ops: A number of operations.  Operations will be detailed below.

   The Opcode field indicates the type of operation.

      0x0 (reserved) -- this is not used and is reserved in case a
      token-based delimiter is required in the future.

      0x1 (Toggle) indicates that the data which follows will be an lru-
      index.  That lru-index, if present in the current header-group
      will be removed from the header group.  If it is not present in

      headers for whatever frame includes the HeaderBlock

      0x1 (Clone) indicates that the data which follows will be a key-
      index and a string literal.  The key-index is used to refer to a
      pre-existing key, and thus the operation results in the storing of
      the pre-existing key and the new value.  The key-value will be
      appended to the LRU, and the index in the LRU added to the current
      header group.

      0x2 (KVSto) indicates that the data which follows will be two
      string literals.  The first such string represents a new key to be
      stored, and the second such string represents a value.  As with
      Clone, the key-value will be stored in the LRU with a new index,
      and that index will be added to the current header group.

      0x2 (Eref) indicates that the data which follows will be two
      string literals.  The first such string represents key, and the
      second string represents a value.  Unlike KVSto, the Eref does not
      modify the compressor state-- it only specified a key-value which
      will be interpreted as being part of the meta-data for the frame
      which includes the HeaderBlock.

   String are always encoded as a single bit, followed by data.  If that
   bit is '0', then what follows is 7-bit us-ascii, null-terminated.  If
   that bit is '1', then it is huffman encoded using a canonical
   huffman-code and ends with an 'eof' character (which is not part of
   the string).  If the last bit of the EOF is not immediately before
   the byte boundary, the remaining bits of that byte are padded with
   zero.  Strings in a request are encoded with a different huffman-
   encoder than strings in a response, as the frequency of occurance in
   these differ by quite a bit.

              A string is either:
              +-|============================|====================|--------+
              |1| huffman-encoded-characters | huffman-eof-symbol |pad-bits|
              +-|============================|====================|--------+

              or

              +-|-------+========+--------+
              |0|  7 bit-ascii   |00000000|
              +-|-------+========+--------+

   The NumOps field encodes one minus the number of operations that
   follow.  Since the field-width is 8 bits, a maximum of 256 ops can be
   represented.  If more than 256 operations are required, simply repeat
   doing this until all operations have been encoded.  It is expected
   that this will be extremely rare.

   Each header name must have at least one value.  Header names are
   encoded using the US-ASCII character set [ASCII] and must be all
   lower case.  The length of each name must be greater than zero.  A
   recipient of a zero-length name MUST issue a stream error
   (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a>) with the status code PROTOCOL_ERROR for the
   stream-id.

   Duplicate header names are allowed, but discouraged, except when
   encoding a cookie or set-cookie.

   The Name/Value Header Block is a section of the HEADERS+PRIORITY,
   HEADERS, and PUSH_PROMISE frames used to carry header meta-data.
   This block is always compressed using zlib compression.  Within this
   specification, any reference to 'zlib' is referring to the ZLIB
   Compressed Data Format Specification Version 3.3 as part of <a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=1950">RFC1950</a>.
   [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=1950">RFC1950</a>]

   For each HEADERS compression instance, the initial state is
   initialized using the following dictionary [UDELCOMPRESSION]:

<span class="h3"><a name="section-2.7">2.7</a>.  Frame Types</span>

   This specification defines a number of frame types, each identified
   by a unique 8-bit type code.  Each frame type serves a distinct
   purpose either in the establishment and management of the connection
   as a whole, or of individual streams.

   The transmission of specific frame types can alter the state of a
   connection.  If endpoints fail to maintain a synchronized view of the
   connection state, successful communication within the connection will
   no longer be possible.  Therefore, it is important that endpoints
   have a shared comprehension of how the state is affected by the use
   any given frame.  Accordingly, while it is expected that new frame
   types will be introduced by extensions to this protocol, only frames
   defined by this document are permitted to alter the connection state.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.1">2.7.1</a>.  DATA Frames</span>

   DATA frames (type=0x0) convey arbitrary, variable-length sequences of
   octets associated with a stream.  One or more DATA frames are used,
   for instance, to carry HTTP request or response payloads.

   The DATA frame defines the following flag:

   MSG_DONE (0x2):  Bit 2 being set signifies that this frame represents
      the last frame of a message.  This is relevant for layering of
      message-based protocols on top of SPDY.

   DATA frames MUST be associated with a stream.  If a DATA frame is
   received whose stream identifier field is 0x0, the recipient MUST
   respond with a connection error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.2">2.7.2</a>.  HEADERS+PRIORITY</span>

   The HEADERS+PRIORITY frame (type=0x1) allows the sender to set header
   fields and stream priority at the same time.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   The HEADERS+PRIORITY frame is identical to the HEADERS frame
   (<a href="#section-2.7.8">Section 2.7.8</a>), preceded by a single reserved bit and a 31-bit
   priority; see <a href="#section-2.4.2">Section 2.4.2</a>.

   HEADERS+PRIORITY uses the same flags as the HEADERS frame, except
   that a HEADERS+PRIORITY frame with a CONTINUES bit MUST be followed
   by another HEADERS+PRIORITY frame.  See HEADERS frame (<a href="#section-2.7.8">Section 2.7.8</a>)
   for any flags.

   HEADERS+PRIORITY frames MUST be associated with a stream.  If a
   HEADERS+PRIORITY frame is received whose stream identifier field is
   0x0, the recipient MUST respond with a connection error
   (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   The HEADERS+PRIORITY frame modifies the connection state as defined
   in <a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.3">2.7.3</a>.  RST_STREAM</span>

   The RST_STREAM frame (type=0x3) allows for abnormal termination of a
   stream.  When sent by the initiator of a stream, it indicates that
   they wish to cancel the stream.  When sent by the receiver of a
   stream, it indicates that either the receiver is rejecting the
   stream, requesting that the stream be cancelled or that an error
   condition has occurred.

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                         RST_STREAM Frame Payload

   The RST_STREAM frame contains a single unsigned, 32-bit integer
   identifying the error code (<a href="#section-2.5.3">Section 2.5.3</a>).  The error code indicates
   why the stream is being terminated.

   No type-flags are defined.

   The RST_STREAM frame fully terminates the referenced stream and
   causes it to enter the closed state.  After receiving a RST_STREAM on
   a stream, the receiver MUST NOT send additional frames for that
   stream.  However, after sending the RST_STREAM, the sending endpoint
   MUST be prepared to receive and process additional frames sent on the
   stream that might have been sent by the peer prior to the arrival of
   the RST_STREAM.

   RST_STREAM frames MUST be associated with a stream.  If a RST_STREAM
   frame is received whose stream identifier field is 0x0 the recipient
   MUST respond with a connection error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.4">2.7.4</a>.  SETTINGS</span>

   The SETTINGS frame (type=0x4) conveys configuration parameters that
   affect how endpoints communicate.  The parameters are either
   constraints on peer behavior or preferences.

   SETTINGS frames MUST be sent at the start of a connection, and MAY be
   sent at any other time by either endpoint over the lifetime of the
   connection.

   Implementations MUST support all of the settings defined by this
   specification and MAY support additional settings defined by
   extensions.  Unsupported or unrecognized settings MUST be ignored.
   New settings MUST NOT be defined or implemented in a way that
   requires endpoints to understand them in order to communicate
   successfully.

   A SETTINGS frame is not required to include every defined setting;
   senders can include only those parameters for which it has accurate
   values and a need to convey.  When multiple parameters are sent, they
   SHOULD be sent in order of numerically lowest ID to highest ID.  A
   single SETTINGS frame MUST NOT contain multiple values for the same
   ID.  If the receiver of a SETTINGS frame discovers multiple values
   for the same ID, it MUST ignore all values for that ID except the
   first one.

   Over the lifetime of a connection, an endpoint MAY send multiple
   SETTINGS frames containing previously unspecified parameters or new
   values for parameters whose values have already been established.
   Only the most recent value provided setting value applies.

   The SETTINGS frame defines the following flag:

   CLEAR_PERSISTED (0x2):  Bit 2 being set indicates a request to clear
      any previously persisted settings before processing the settings.
      Clients MUST NOT set this flag.

   SETTINGS frames always apply to a connection, never a single stream.
   The stream identifier for a settings frame MUST be zero.  If an
   endpoint receives a SETTINGS frame whose stream identifier field is
   anything other than 0x0, the endpoint MUST respond with a connection
   error (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.4.1">2.7.4.1</a>.  Setting Format</span>

   The payload of a SETTINGS frame consists of zero or more settings.
   Each setting consists of an 8-bit flags field specifying per-item
   instructions, an unsigned 24-bit setting identifier, and an unsigned
   32-bit value.

                              Setting Format

   Two flags are defined for the 8-bit flags field:

   PERSIST_VALUE (0x1):  Bit 1 (the least significant bit) being set
      indicates a request from the server to the client to persist this
      setting.  A client MUST NOT set this flag.

   PERSISTED (0x2):  Bit 2 being set indicates that this setting is a
      persisted setting being returned by the client to the server.
      This also indicates that this setting is not a client setting, but
      a value previously set by the server.  A server MUST NOT set this
      flag.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.4.2">2.7.4.2</a>.  Setting Persistence</span>

   [[anchor10: Note that persistence of settings is under discussion in
   the WG and might be removed in a future version of this document.]]

   A server endpoint can request that configuration parameters sent to a
   client in a SETTINGS frame are to be persisted by the client across
   SPDY connections and returned to the server in any new SETTINGS frame
   the client sends to the server in the current connection or any
   future connections.

   Persistence is requested on a per-setting basis by setting the
   PERSIST_VALUE flag (0x1).

   Client endpoints are not permitted to make such requests.  Servers
   MUST ignore any attempt by clients to request that a server persist
   configuration parameters.

   Persistence of configuration parameters is done on a per-origin basis

   (see [<a href="./rfcmarkup?rfc=6454">RFC6454</a>]).  That is, when a client establishes a connection
   with a server, and the server requests that the client maintain
   persistent settings, the client SHOULD return the persisted settings
   on all future connections to the same origin, IP address and TCP
   port.

   Whenever the client sends a SETTINGS frame in the current connection,
   or establishes a new connection with the same origin, persisted
   configuration parameters are sent with the PERSISTED flag (0x2) set
   for each persisted parameter.

   Persisted settings accumulate until the server requests that all
   previously persisted settings are to be cleared by setting the
   CLEAR_PERSISTED (0x2) flag on the SETTINGS frame.

   For example, if the server sends IDs 1, 2, and 3 with the
   FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE in a first SETTINGS frame, and then sends
   IDs 4 and 5 with the FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE in a subsequent
   SETTINGS frame, the client will return values for all 5 settings (1,
   2, 3, 4, and 5 in this example) to the server.

<span class="h5"><a name="section-2.7.4.3">2.7.4.3</a>.  Defined Settings</span>

   SETTINGS_UPLOAD_BANDWIDTH (1):  indicates the sender's estimated
      upload bandwidth for this connection.  The value is an the
      integral number of kilobytes per second that the sender predicts
      as an expected maximum upload channel capacity.

   SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_BANDWIDTH (2):  indicates the sender's estimated
      download bandwidth for this connection.  The value is an integral
      number of kilobytes per second that the sender predicts as an
      expected maximum download channel capacity.

   SETTINGS_ROUND_TRIP_TIME (3):  indicates the sender's estimated
      round-trip-time for this connection.  The round trip time is
      defined as the minimum amount of time to send a control frame from
      this client to the remote and receive a response.  The value is
      represented in milliseconds.

   SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS (4):  indicates the maximum number of
      concurrent streams that the sender will allow.  This limit is
      directional: it applies to the number of streams that the sender
      permits the receiver to create.  By default there is no limit.  It
      is recommended that this value be no smaller than 100, so as to
      not unnecessarily limit parallelism.

   SETTINGS_CURRENT_CWND (5):  indicates the sender's current TCP CWND
      value.

   SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_RETRANS_RATE (6):  indicates the sender's
      retransmission rate (bytes retransmitted / total bytes
      transmitted).

   SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE (7):  indicates the sender's initial
      stream window size (in bytes) for new streams.

   SETTINGS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_VECTOR_SIZE (8):  indicates the sender's
      (which should be the server) size of the client certificate
      vector.

   SETTINGS_SUPPORTING_SCHEMES (9):  indicates the sender's supported
      overlayering protocol schemes.  The corresponding value must be a
      32-bit value, and which contains flags as follows:

         bit 0: http

         bit 1: https

         bit 2: ws

         bit 3: wss

   SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS (10):  indicates that streams directed
      to the sender will not be subject to flow control.  The least
      significant bit (0x1) is set to indicate that new streams are not
      flow controlled.  All other bits are reserved.  This setting
      applies to all streams, including existing streams.  These bits
      cannot be cleared once set, see <a href="#section-2.7.9.4">Section 2.7.9.4</a>.

<span class="h4"><a name="section-2.7.5">2.7.5</a>.  PUSH_PROMISE</span>

   The PUSH_PROMISE frame (type=0x5) is used to notify the peer endpoint
   in advance of streams the sender intends to initiate.  The
   PUSH_PROMISE frame includes the unsigned 31-bit identifier of the
   stream the endpoint plans to create along with a minimal set of
